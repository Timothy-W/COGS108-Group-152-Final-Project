    "We know that homophobic and misogynistic lyrics are present within a wide range of music genres. More specifically, hip-hop and rap music is notable for promoting them. Music has always been about freely expressing the artist’s creativity, however, sometimes their lyrics are misunderstood. Homophobic and misogynistic lyrics in genres most notably hip-hop and rap genre is very prevalent in reinforcing these stereotypes and promote hostility against these groups. Lyrics that describe masculinity and homosexuality through insult or “dissing” are very common among songs withing the rap genere. Other genres such as pop music also have some notion of homophobic or sexist lyrics. For example, Katy Perry released a song about her ex-boyfriend and describes her hatred being in a relationship with him using homophobic lyrics.\n",
    " \n",
    "Furthermore, country music can also promote masculinity and express homophobia. For example, a country music group named “Big & Rich” rants about how the legalization of gay marriage can result in legalizing other phobic things. Likewise, we can observe the prevalent use of these terms not just for personal expression but also to add commentary on several political issues that are controversial within the time period that the song was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a similar project called “Using Python to Analyze Billboard Top 100 Pop Songs”. This group used a kaggle data set containing 50 years of Top Pop songs from 1964-2015 that had columns for Rank, Song, Artist, Year, Lyrics, Source. The lyrics for these songs they analyzed by Sentiment using the sentiwordnet interface. They also analyzed the repetitiveness of songs using compression. This group had to remove repetitive words in their analysis when they ran it through sentiwordnet. This might be something we will have to do with our dataset. This group also used a scatterplot and linear regression to map sentiment. We may have to attempt a similar approach.\n",
