2000,1,Breathe,Faith Hill,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe, just breathe
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way"
2000,2,Smooth,Santana ,"Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whispering and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu√±equita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove, yeah

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood, yeah
'Cause you're so smooth

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

Well, I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave, it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out, yeah
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you 'round and 'round

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood, yeah
'Cause you're so smooth

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
Yeah

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it, yeah

Or else forget about it
Oh, or else forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real
Oh, let's don't forget about it, yeah
Let's don't forget about it, yeah, oh no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, oh no, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, yeah, oh no
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Yeah, yeah"

2000,5,Everything You Want,Vertical Horizon,"Somewhere there's speaking, it's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
And now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why

And I don't know why
Why
And I don't know"

2000,7,I Knew I Loved You,Savage Garden,"Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I've found you

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

(I knew I loved you before I met you) Ooh
(I knew I loved you)
(I knew I loved you before I met you) Ooh

2000,8,Amazed,Lonestar,"Every time our eyes meet
This feelin' inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh, it feels like the first time everytime
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

2000,9,Bent,Matchbox Twenty,"And if I fall along the way
Pick me up and dust me off
And if I get too tired to make it
Be my breath so I can walk

And if I need some other love, then
Give me more than I can stand
And when my smile gets old and faded
Wait around I'll smile again

Shouldn't be so complicated
Just hold me and then
Oh, just hold me again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

And if I couldn't sleep, could you sleep?
Could you paint me better off?
And could you sympathize with my needs?
I know you think I need a lot

I started out clean but I'm jaded
Just phoning it in
Oh, just breaking the skin

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

Start bending me
It's never enough till I feel all your pieces
Start bending me
Keep bending me until I'm completely broken in

Shouldn't be so complicated
Just touch me and then
Oh, just touch me again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me landin' without understanding
Hell, I'd go there again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Yeah, you're breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent"

Darkchild yeah

Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don'tcha know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you react like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first!

What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Then I'd be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl,
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't buy
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Then I'd be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Oh yeah, so many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me"
2000,11,Higher,Creed,"When dreaming
I'm guided to another world
Time and time again

At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave
The comfort of this place

'Cause there's a hunger
A-longing to escape
From the life I live, when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams

But my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make
The earth and my dreams the same

The only difference is
To let love replace
All our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

So let's go there
Let's go there
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Up high, I feel like I'm
Alive for the very first time
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?"

After all I knew it had to be something to do with you

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a-holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down

You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?

I've gotta get away from a love

Ooh
Oh yeah yeah
Listen

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune, still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

So, I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
Said without you girl, ahh listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday, you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year, winter summer spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin', ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
That without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything
To hear you say that you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (all the women)
All the expensive cars (all the money)
All of the money don't amount to you (you can have it all)

I can make believe I have everything (just give me my baby)
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete (alright, alright, alight, alright)

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (I don't have you)
All the expensive cars (I don't have you)
All of the money don't amount to you (it makes me wanna cry)

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete

Without ya girl
Without ya girl my life
Without you girl
My life my life is incomplete
Without you girl
My life is incomplete
Oh yeah
My life is incomplete

Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (Endless love)

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises, never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this shit day after day?
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today?
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Her pretty face, she hid from the world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there

Baby, relax, sit back and chill (yeah)
Just give me a second
And let me tell you how I feel
Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you?
Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good, now the love is gone
And went back to your hood with the 54-11's on

1 - Does he lace you with the finer things?
Does he make ya wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl I thought that your love was strong
Till I saw you in another man's arms

2 - No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP
No more dough
We can't even kick it no more

Repeat 2

I saw you on the Ave' and I laughed
In the backseat beeeze spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me that you was all about
But I'm having doubts
'Cause I see you tryna play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you
When I caught him in the streets
So let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks
And no more hanging baguettes around your neck, babe

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 (4x)

No more, I want no more
Baby, I want no more

Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering

I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you

Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you

'Cause without you beside me, I can't survive
I don't want to try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you, oh

See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess
It shows that we were destined to shine

It took the rain to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

Aman aman aman

I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain

This desert flower
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of the fall

2000,51,The Real Slim Shady,Eminem,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ahh!)

It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!)

Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for <span class=""plainlinks"">Tom Green</span> to hump a dead moose

""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to <span class=""plainlinks"">Britney Spears</span>?
Yo shit, <span class=""plainlinks"">Christina Aguilera</span> better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe""

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' ""I don't give a fuck""
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up"

(Isn't it wonderful, so wonderful, wonderful, etc)
(Isn't everything wonderful?)
(Isn't it wonderful now?)

I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
And make everything be wonderful again

I hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
I hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that makes me wanna cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed and I
Dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say that
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything
When you're little and the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Tell me everything is wonderful now

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all okay
I laugh a lot so my friends won't know
That when the bell rings I just don't want to go home

Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say that
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything
When you're little and the world is so big (so big)
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes

I don't want to hear you tell me
Everything is wonderful now

I don't want to hear you say
That I will understand someday
No, no, no, no
Don't want to hear you say
That you both have grown in a different way
No, no, no

No, I don't want to meet your friend
And I don't want to start over again
I just want my life to be the same
Just like it used to be

Somedays I hate everything
I hate everything
Everyone and everything
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

No
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Don't tell me everything is wonderful now, no

And I never thought I'd fall
Be at the mercy of a man
I've never been
Now I only want to be right where you are.

I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I married the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the other side

Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad

The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
She wants to know ""Am I still a slut?""

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soulmate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I gotta take it on the other side

Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

Burn me out, leave me on the other side

Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22

Someone has to lose

Outstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love

And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand 'bout the shit that I've been through
It's been so long, since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long

Maybe I forgot, all the things I miss
Oh somehow I know there's more to life than this
I said it too many times, and I still stand firm
You get what you put in, and people get what they deserve

Still I ain't seen mine, no I ain't seen mine
I've been giving just ain't been gettin', I've been walking that there line
So I think I'll keep on walking, with my head held high
I'll keep moving on and only God knows why

Only God, only God
Only, God knows why
Only God, knows, why why why
Only God knows why

Take me to the river
Hey won't you take me to the river
Hey hey hey"

She's beautiful

Smokes a pack a day
Oh, wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never compromises
Loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful?
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the President

Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me, hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the President
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her lies
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna live this life

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite, unusual
You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body - unusual

Meet Virginia- I can't wait to
Meet Virginia- Yeah-ey eh eh eh eh

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Well she wants to live her life

Y'all know me, still the same ol' G, but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full o' tracks, to add to the wall full o' plaques 
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees

Who you think brought you the oldies, Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's, and the group that said ""motherfuck tha police""
Gave you a tape full dope beats to bump, when you stroll through in your 'hood
And when your albums sales wasn't doin' too good, who's the doctor they told you to go see

Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I'd turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all o' y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all gon' keep fuckin' around wit' me, and turn me back to the old me

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A

One day I was walkin' by, with a Walkman on, when I caught a guy 
Giving an awkward eye, (What you lookin' at) strangled him up in the parkin' lot with his Karl Kani's
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not, I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck, right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage

Hoppin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off, fuck you too bitch call the cops
I'm 'a kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through, me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches, and still weren't found out (Right here)

So from here on out, it's The Chronic 2, startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew (Chikka-chikka-chikka)

Slim Shady, hotter than a set o' twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up, when the temp goes up to the mid-eighties
Callin' men ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's OK go with him Hailey (Dada)

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop comin' up to me wit' yo' hands out, lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free, when my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I gots lil' company, everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me, 'cause I'm from the streets of (C‚ÄîC‚ÄîCompton, Compton)

I told 'em all, all them lil' gangsters who you think help mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none, what you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off, now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' ""Dre fell off""
What, 'cause I been in the lab, with a pen an' a pad tryna get this damn label off

I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath and ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So gimme one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at, it's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats, when you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

When the money ran out and the engine blew.
Hung my tears out to dry,
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky.

And I, I was walkin' the clouds.
Feelin' so safe and sound.
Somethin' else knocks me down.

Well, oh, that's the way it is!

Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love.
He's just what you're lookin' for,
The only problem is, that the man's not sure.
Another guy'll give you everything,
The only problem is you don't feel a thing.
Well I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense.
Oh, one day you get what you want.

2000,77,From the Bottom of My Broken Heart,Britney Spears,"""Never look back,"" we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead,
Emptiness behind
Where do I go?

And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you now?
Still I miss you somehow...

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love,
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love
Till there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

""Baby,"" I said,
""Please stay. Give our love a chance for one more day""
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about

But you put a dart
Through my dreams
Through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now...

""Never look back,"" we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?"
2000,78,Crash and Burn,Savage Garden,"When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please to tame your wild wild heart
I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you can't take anymore

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one way street
With the monsters in your head
When hopes and dreams are far away and
You feel like you can't face the day

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

'Cause there has always been heartache and pain
And when it's over you'll breathe again
You'll breathe again

When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild wild heart

(Chorus X4... until fade)"
2000,79,Yes!,Chad Brock,"She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny

Oh, and we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Oh, then I asked her, can I see you again

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me

Oh, then it happened one night, looking in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question, much to my surprise

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So we called the preacher, family and friends
And nothing's been the same since she said yes
I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
She said yes"
2000,80,The Best Day,George Strait,"We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back

When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
About the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now it's me and her
Watching you and mom I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life

I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life"
2000,81,Where I Wanna Be,Donell Jones,"(Verse one)
I just left my baby girl a message, said I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
'Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time

I could be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her
But I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how, I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

(Verse two)
Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
Think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone but I
Have to find what life is like without you"
2000,82,How Do You Like Me Now?!,Toby Keith,"I was always the crazy one
Who broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number
On the fifty yard line
You were always the perfect one
And a valedictorian
So under your number I wrote
Call for a good time
I only wanted to get your attention
But you over looked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!

When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
You never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into the money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin' who could that be singin'
It's me baby with your wake up call

How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!
 
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!

Tell me baby!
I will preach on! Haha"
2000,83,My Best Friend,Tim McGraw,"I never had no one that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life

It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You stand by me
And you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

2000,84,Broadway,Goo Goo Dolls,"Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls

Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world
Like it's someplace that you've been

You see you'd love to run home
But you know you ain't got one
'Cause you're livin' in a world that
You're best forgotten, around here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the loser's day parade

You see you'd love to run home
But you know ain't got one
'Cause you're livin' in a world
That you're best forgotten
When you're thinkin' of a joke
Ain't nobody gonna listen
To the one small point
I know they've been missin' round here

And you still be sweating me
I don't see nothing wrong with giving a little love
But nigga just let me breathe
Damn, you cute as hell so let's switch the digits
Then I got to leave
And you can buy me a couple of drinks
But I'mma go socialize and smoke my weed
And I like it when you keep your eyes on me
And I like it when you touch my privacy
And I like it sex and ecstasy
When the belt buckle loosen up, undress me
Already juiced up, that come naturally
Wax on and off so romantically
No woman can slow dance or throw down like I can
Ask if you curious to know what I like, man

(Da Brat)
Let me tell you something
Well I start at the top of the list
With my pretty eyes, a cute nose and these fat ass lips
My medallion sit in the middle of my tits
It's hit after hit, shit sweet every sip
Down to the last drip drop, watch the hips rock
Color Me Bad, tick tock you don't stop
Till the thick thighs, dick rise when I skip by

2000,86,Don't Think I'm Not,Kandi,"Now I don't have to question
Where you were last night
'Cause I already know what you will say
I already know you lie
But I can't be mad at ya
'Cause there's something that you don't know
That when you're gone I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're doggin' me

When you're out in the club
Don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love
Don't think I'm not
When you're feelin' good in somebody's spot
Gettin' hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not
'Cause I'm out gettin' mine

When I try to get your attention
You ignore me every time
You were so caught up doin' your dirt
That you didn't notice mine
Well I couldn't put up with your schemin'
And I couldn't put up with your lies
They say that two wrongs won't make it right
But it's suiting me just fine

Don't be surprised to know
That sometimes women play the field
You may not believe it
But it's real, the game is so real
So real, so real
Oh, don't think we won't do it
When you're out in the club"
2000,87,I Hope You Dance,Lee Ann Womack,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance..........

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance
I hope you dance....I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone)

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,

Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

We always said someday, somehow
We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town

What about now, how 'bout tonight
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now

We've been puttin' this off baby long enough
Just give me the word, and we'll be kickin' up dust
We both know it's just a matter of time
Till our hearts start racin' for that county line

What about now, how 'bout tonight

But there won't ever be a better time to take this chance

Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?

Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV

Met her at a counter affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt out of place
Till she looked into my eyes

Shook your hand around 9 p.m.
And I'm never gonna be the same again
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

Shooby-doo-wop and scobby snacks, met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me if they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheesy, I think I fell for the girl on TV

I wanna take a picture and they're glad she came
But I just wanna be there when she's down, down

I don't want her autograph
I just wanna call her up and make her laugh

Yeah, so I wish for you on a bright shining star
Every where I look, there you are, there you are
It's the girl in the green dress, she took my breath away
And now I look to the sky for a better day

To the beach shore and scooby snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Never had to be on a movie screen

It's so so def
And uh it's goin' down
Ya know what I mean?
My man bow wow
Bow wow, yeah hear me now
Yeah ya heard?
Let's go, let's go, let's go

Around here we pop them collars
Around here we get them dollars
Every girl I see that look right
A nigga like me just gotta holla
This kid here all about stackin' up
Got big head but we can back it up
Long 'cause everybody get crunk
When we drop in the club starts acting up
I represent the s o s o, d e f m o b
That's me, J D, da brat, and J E
So please believe
What I do ain't never been done
Ohio is where I'm from
I heard what you said
And I saw what you do
And y'all playas really don't want none
From the day to the night, I rock
Say what you like, never not
Stayin' alive, living the life
Gots to keep it hot
Shotgun in the drop
Riding good, twenties, TV's, leather and wood
Poppin', watching big momma
Holdin' it down like a playa should
Sing a long now

All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me

It's the B to the O W
Wow even your girl fall in love
When I smile
The tight little guy you ain't seen in a while
Ignore the hype, just right for you size
I get in where I fit in
Braided up, made the bucks
And I'm still a kid
Imagine what life like when I get big
I'm ma be rich surrounded by chicks
Couple of cars, couple of cribs
Gettin' a couple of mills
Shining every time I feel
You see how so so get ill
You don't want no stuff up in here
Bow to the wow, in your ear now
I get down 'cause I'm hit bound
And I rock an iced out Mickey Mouse around my neck
And I hang on niggas like Vince Carter
With my arm in the net
And I outta snatch up your daughters
But I was brought up with respect
When I turn sixteen I'm ma call her though
And show her how to ride with a baller yo
Let her know why it wouldn't hurt her
To fall in love with a nigga like me along time ago
Sing a long now

All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me

I, I, I wanna see you bounce with me now
Take, take, take it down to the ground with me now
Shake, shake, shake it all around the town with me now
What'cha gon do shorty, what'cha gon do"

I want to break it in my hands
I want to grow something wild and unruly
I want to sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me

I said, cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you 
Closer to you

I want to walk and not run
I want to skip and not fall
I want to look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I want to be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh I pray

I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips, on my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I never thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah

Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance?
Five-hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had

To bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy hoes they one and the same

Ever since you told me

There's only room for two, I been making less room for you.

Now only God can hold me

Hug me, love me, judge me, the only man that hovers above me... holla!

Laughing like we wasn't happy
But not knowing that we growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin', straight thuggin'

2001,6,If You're Gone,Matchbox Twenty,"I think I've already lost you (lost you)
I think you're already gone (gone)
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong

I think you're already leaving
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure

And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need
This in my life and
I think I'm scared
I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing

If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Baby you need to come home
Oh, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

I bet you're hard to get over
I bet the room just won't shine
I bet my hands I can stay here
And I bet you need
More than you mind

And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need
This in my life
I think I'm just scared
That I know too much
I can't relate and that's a problem I'm feeling

If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move, yeah
If you're gone
Baby you need to come home
Aw, come home
There's a little bit of something me in everything in you

I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need (need)

Do I talk too much?
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing

2001,7,Let Me Blow Ya Mind,Eve ,"Eve:
Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you havin' hot flashes

Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin'

Expressway, head back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'

Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writin well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Gisell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

Gwen Stefani:
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere

It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Eve:
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now why you grittin' your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to sayin' ""Get what you see.""
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe?

Huh, sixteen's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach, wishin' I wrote your rhymes

Gwen Stefani:
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere

It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Eve:
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, block shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out

Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor, too

Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)

Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

Gwen Stefani:
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door

2001,8,Thank You,Dido,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you, is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
And then you handed me your towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you is having the best day of my life
And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you is having the best day of my life"
2001,9,Again,Lenny Kravitz,"I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Now here you are walking right through my door

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better, worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Or take your crown, never

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I've searched through time
I've always known
That you were there upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I've longed for you my love forever


All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again..."

I was leanin' in the Beamer just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'

So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shoppin' spree, ah
And on the way I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cash box rang, I thought everything away 

Oops, there goes the dreams we used to say

Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get ya hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

While he was braggin'
I was comin' down the hill just a-draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away

To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is better than money, you see

2001,12,It Wasn't Me,Shaggy ,"Yo, man.
Yo.
Open up, man.
What do you want, man?
My girl just caught me.
You let her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen.
With who?
The girl next door, you know?
Man...
I don't know what to do.
Say it wasn't you.
Alright...

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you fi grant the woman access to your villa
Trespass and a witness while you up in a your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you're caught up inna

To be a true player, you fi know how fi play
If she say a night, convince her, say a day
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, ""Baby, no way""

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me when
I told her it wasn't me?

Make sure knows she nuh she really on a right fi vex
A never you she see a make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seeing is believing, so you better change your specs

You know she a go bring up all of the things up from the past
All the little evidence you better know fi mask
Quick pon your answer, know how fi talk
But if she back a gun, you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason, it makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost

'Cause I say
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had

2001,14,It's Been Awhile,Staind,"It's been awhile since I could hold my head high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

It's been awhile since I can say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile since I could say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

But you remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through (oh no no no)

Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two

2001,21,Drive,Incubus,"Sometimes
I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear
Take the wheel and steer

It's driven me before and seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there

So, if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive? Aah ah ooo

It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find
That when I drive myself my light is found

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there

Would you choose water over wine?

Saturday night was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five, six strippers trying to work for a buck

And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lila, she went to junior high with me
I said: ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot has changed since I've seen you last"", she said

(What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money)

(And his daddy's gone, somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life, mmm)

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
But that's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said: ""Everyday I wake up hoping to die""

She said: ""Nigga, I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I'd done been through more shit you can't even relate to""

Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
(What would you do?)
'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through

She doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rip you up, start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit, you never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you do is defend that lady when I call you, yee yee

Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic, but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine and if I'm blind, fine
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever, forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it, need some knee
Pads, it happened for a reason, one can't be
Mad, so know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school
And graduation

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I apologize a trillion times

‚ÄúLook at the way he treats me‚Äù
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
You got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And then you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Talking about jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating, beating, and to the G they be the same thing
So who you be placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

2001,26,Love Don't Cost a Thing,Jennifer Lopez,"Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughtta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When I took a chance, thought you'd understand
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
Still, you're tryin' to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
You're doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys? I've got to go

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

A thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart, don't know what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own

2001,29,Butterfly,Crazy Town,"Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So, to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try

Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passing, I'm asking, ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so, yo, I'm putting it down

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew till I met you

See, I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, parole, the police files

So, yo
What's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down a few dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey, sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy

So sexy, almost evil
Talk about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So, butterfly, here is a song
And it's sealed with a kiss and a ""Thank you, miss.""

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So, come and dance with me, uh-huh, uh-huh

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

2001,32,I Hope You Dance,Lee Ann Womack,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance..........

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance
I hope you dance....I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone)

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.

Dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance..

Watching out for a sunny day where there's

Love and darkness and my sidearm
Hey, elan

Ride at night we ride all day
Looking out for a sunny day

She'd phone, say ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door, you were standing
With a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin, lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me 'bout jacuzzi, sounded interesting, so we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
""Please leave a message after the tone""

I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?
Calls diverted to answerphone, red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return, jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in?"" (It's another one, it's another one)

Whenever the coast was clear, and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door, I was standing
With the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down, bounce bounce to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Saying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out with the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?
Wearing a jacket: whose property? Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (You told me)
Can you fill me in?"" (Can you fill me in?)

All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby (Craig David)
Watching your every move
Think some day they might approve? Baby

Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
Calls diverted to answerphone, red wine bottle half the contents gone (Ooh yeah)
Midnight return, jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"

2001,41,All or Nothing,O-Town,"I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over

It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right, I know it, know it

Don't make me promises
Baby you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall its now or never

Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

Is it all or nothing at all?

Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing here all alone

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day when I was through
This I promise you
This I promise you

I've loved you forever
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore?
I give you my words, I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow
Forever has now begun

Just close your eyes each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away
No, till the day when I was through
This I promise you
This I promise you

Over and over I fall
When I hear you call
Without you in my life baby
I just wouldn't be living at all, oh oh oh

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Oh, till the day when I was through

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century... oh it's timeless... HOV'!
Thanks for comin' out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that... uuunnnh...

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin' 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Holla at me...
I do this for my culture
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up
I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks

(Jay-Z)
Yeah...
Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
Niggaz actin' like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the pro-jects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great

I guess I ain't got no reason to mingle round
I found a superwoman that can leap from the truck in a single bound
Mammie, I'm tryna bling you down
So niggas without shades on can't stare when I bring you round
She put her lips on the weed and pull it
Then work her tongue and me cum faster than a speeding bullet
Her love's stronger than a locomotive
But only for the f-a-b-o-l-o-u-s
Sing to me ma

Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman

They don't know any girls like me no no
Take a girl like me to get a guy like you to understand
How girls and guys sing
I'm not your average chic
'Cause they can't do it like this
I've been sent to save your day
And things won't be the same

Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman

Boy I told you once before
You ain't gotta look up in the sky
Cause the girl you need is right before your eyes
Your so sick of all these broads
Ain't got nothing to stand for
'Cause with me you won't fall off no baby ooh

Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman

Everyday, Everyday
I'll love you in a special way
They can't stay
Now that I'm here, I'm here

It's superwoman bout to save my day
Them co's I hooked and gave some play
Now I wouldn't even wave their way
I understand why them other chics behave that way
They see the icy S on your chest engraved in grey
Be hipped I might
You usually get my tips I'm tight
The only green I keep from you in kryptonite
When that blowing red suit hits your hips so right
It's like de de de de, de de de de de de damn
It's like I'm under your spell
If feelin' you is a crime
They gon have to put me under the jail
You probably hear the details that I be in everything
From lairs to CL's to my share of the females but
You know I care for you (care for me)
And anytime this nigga's there for you (there for me)
These feelings I only share for you
This makes it a lil mo clear for you that

Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman"

And she talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by,

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly,
But she don't know how I feel,
And as she carries on without a doubt,
I wonder if she's figured out,
I'm crazy for this girl.

She was the one to hold me,
The night the sky fell down,
And what was I thinkin' when,
The world didn't end?
Why didn't I know what I know now?

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly,
But she don't know how I feel,
And as she carries on without a doubt,
I wonder if she's figured out,
I'm crazy for this girl.

I'm crazy for this girl,
And right now,
Face to face, all my fears,
Pushed aside and right now,
I'm ready to spend,
The rest of my life with you.

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly,
But she don't know how I feel,
And as she carries on without a doubt,
I wonder if she's figured out,

If your love grows
As your heart chose
Only time

Who can say
Why your heart sighs
As your love flies
Only time
And who can say
Why your heart cries
When your love lies
Only time

Who can say
When the roads meet
That love might be
In your heart.
And who can say
When the day sleeps
If the night keeps
All your heart.

Night keeps all your heart

Who can say
If your love grows
As your heart chose
Only time
And who can say
Where the road goes
Where the day flows
Only time

Who knows - only time
Who knows - only time"
2001,60,I Do!!,Toya,"He was a 6 foot stallion say the storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpatatin' every time he came near
He had a spankin new Range sport a tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his hair was corn-rowed
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

'Cause I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

Me and my crew started groovin made our way to the floor
It's time activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me I felt fingertips
On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin' hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this thug my man that I can tell you, for sure

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

'Cause I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Now watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin' all the pappi's want me but all I want is you

(I do)

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know

Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type

Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire

Come home late
It seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So if you want some lovin', I suggest you go back there
Where you came from

Working my nerve, God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through 'cause I been so true to you

In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Got me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do

2001,65,The Space Between,Dave Matthews Band,"You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between
Our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time

The space between"

And the dreams we left behind,
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get,
To have you in my life,

When I look back on these days,
I look and see your face,
You were right there for me.

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,

I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,

Well you showed me how it feels,
To feel the sky within my reach,
And I always will remember all,
The strength you gave to me,
Your love made me make it through,
Oh I owe so much to you,
You were right there for me.

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,

I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,

'Cause I always saw you in my light, my strength,
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways,
You were right there for me, you were right there for me
You were right there for me,
For always

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,

So many things I've got to tell you
But I'm afraid I don't know how
Cause there's a possibility
You'll look at me differently
Love
Ever since the first moment I spoke your name
From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change cause

Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joy and hurt
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

Many days I've longed for you
Wanting you


Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your touch, your feel, your essence
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real
With no doubts and no fears
And no questions

At first you didn't mean that much to me
But now I know that you're all I need
The world looks so brand new to me
Now that I found love
Everyday I live for you
And everything that I do
I do it for you
What I say is how I feel so believe it's true
You got to know I'm true"

Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playin' my song

Play, come on, play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on.
Play, come on DJ play that song you know that it turns me on
DJ just play that song
Just turn it up and turn me on

DJ just play that song, 'cause I wanna be dancin' all night long
Won't ya play my, play my, play my, play my, play my favorite song

I don't care if everybody's gone turn it up 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancin' all night long, feels so right that it can't be wrong
I get chills up and down my spine whenever I hear that song of mine

2001,73,I'm Already There,Lonestar,"He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
And when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
She said Daddy when you coming home?
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said, I really miss you darlin'
Don't worry about the kids
They'll be all right
Wish I was in your arms
Lyin' right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that I share?
Oh I'm already there

We may be a
Thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you
Wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh I'm already there
Oh I'm already there"

2001,75,Beautiful Day,U2,"The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town

You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend, a hand
In return for grace

It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination

You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Oh

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood, all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have, you don't need it now
What you don't know, you can feel it somehow
What you don't have, you don't need it now
Don't need it now

It's a beautiful day"
2001,76,Austin,Blake Shelton,"She left without leaving a number 
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin 
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year 
Before she called him up,
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If your calling 'bout the car, I sold it,
If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling
If you got something to sell
Your wasting your time
I'm not buying
If it's anybody else
Wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin 
I still love you.

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kinda man would hang on that long
What kinda love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night,
I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake 
And I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back
When I get home 
On Sunday afternoon,
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

This time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone
On Sunday evening
And this is what he hear

If you're calling 'bout my heart
It's still yours
I shoulda listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have
Taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell this is Austin
And I still love you
...I still love you"

2001,78,Grown Men Don't Cry,Tim McGraw,"I pulled into the shopping center
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother.
Like ice cream melting, they embraced,
Years of bad decisions running down her face.
All mornin' I'd been thinking my life's so hard,
And they wore everything they owned, living in a car.
I wanted to tell 'em it would be okay,
But I just got in my Suburban and I drove away.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.

Keep having this dream about my old man,
I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand.
We're talking on the front porch
Watching the sun go down,
But it was just a dream.
He was a slave to his job
And he couldn't be around.
So many things I want to say to him,
But I just placed a rose on his grave,
And I talked to the wind.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry.

I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life.
We say grace, and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for.
Then its up the stairs and off to bed
And my little girl says,
""I haven't had my story, yet.""
And everything weighing on my mind disapears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says,
""I love you, dad!""

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry."

Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, ima leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangsters an hoe's go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me
'Cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky
Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?
And do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama, Dodge and White Rolls

'Cause we fucks when I'm home, phone sex when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus I freaks off like O-Dog in ""Love Jones""
Been in, many zones, baby one hoes, two hoes
From, prissy bitches to hoes that do porno
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
And got all these hoes, givin' it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, diggin them out, foot on the clutch

I wanna feel your passion, come when you ask me
Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'
But ain't nothin' happenin'
The bitch got a little too high
Picked up my ride and started crackin'
The radio blastin' ""Between Me And You""
But you ain't on the low with that freak thing you do
I thought you knew (What I do)
Know I know (What you do)
'Cause it's been a good night, your head ain't right

And grind it out, takin' no times out

2001,85,Don't Happen Twice,Kenny Chesney,"I haven't seen you in forever,
Aw you haven't changed a bit.
You didn't think that I remembered,
How could I forget?

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky.
One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
For the first time in my life.
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice.

To this day I still taste that first kiss.
How I prayed it wouldn't end,
And in a way seeing you like this
I guess it never really did.

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky.
One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
For the first time in my life.
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice.

One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's somethin'
Baby that's somethin'
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice
Oh yeah

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
Made a wish on every star

One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Yeah we fell in love"
2001,86,One More Day,Diamond Rio,"Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me,
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished, for one more day with you.

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you.

--- Instrumental ---
One more day.

First thing I'd do, is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone
And keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do, with one more day with you.

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you.

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you.

Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day
With you.

One more day..."
2001,87,I Wish,R. Kelly,"I wish, I wish, I wish
(To every city, every hood and every block)
I wish, I wish
(Ghetto America)
I wish, I wish, I wish,
I wish, I wish, I wish

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped to say what's up
And let you know your baby boy ain't doin' so tough
Even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night cryin' tears
Just thinkin' about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin'on this Hennessy
And remember we'd brag on how rich we would be
To get out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know
The half
I would give it all up just to take on ride with you
How I used to kick it on the front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
With you
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say
Boy, you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me
Shootin' this real shit off like a gun
Mmmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a
Bentley and a house
That's why
Fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass player get a real player hatin'em
""Honey Love"" goes platinum and y'all ass come 'round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is goin' down

And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride with you
How I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends
With you
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn... my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head
Be tellin' me to come to church
Say the lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows
Black-tinted like a hearse
But waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans

And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to street perform on Friday
With you and how I'd go to church on
Easter Sunday
With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish"
2001,88,It's a Great Day to Be Alive,Travis Tritt,"I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three-day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's goofy thing but I just gotta say, ""Hey
I'm a-doin' alright""

Yeah, I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink- nor drug-induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?
Aw, yeah

It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best, and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in the mirror, and what do I see?
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth, but harmless as can be
Lord, I guess he's doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?

Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon
Awoo
Awoo

Well, I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three-day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?
Awoo"

Are you the now or never kind?
In a day and a day love
I'm gonna be gone for good again

Are you willing to be had?
Are you cool with just tonight?
Here's a toast to all those
Who hear me all too well

Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon

Put your name on the line
Along with place and time
Wanna stay not to go
I wanna ditch the logical

Here's a toast to all those
Who hear me all too well

Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry

Can't I stay an hour or two or more?
Don't let me let you go

Don't let me let you go

2001,91,You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This,Toby Keith,"I've got a funny feeling
The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time

There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancing is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
The way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now

2001,96,Be Like That,3 Doors Down,"He spent his whole life bein' too young
To live the life that's in his dreams
At night he lies awake and he wonders
""Why can't that be me?""

'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things he'd rather not mention right now
Just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I can be like that, what would I do?
What would I do? Yeah

Now in dreams we run

She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home and a warm bed on a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold on to
That's all she needs, yeah

Tight blue jeans, air max
Small Gucci bag

Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleepin' in my bedroom
When henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Lomg in a cherry thong with the lights on

If I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?
Oh please tell me this.
Now, would you die
For the one you love?
Hold me in your arms tonight.

I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.

Would you swear
That you'll always be mine?
Would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight.

Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

Oh hold me now I feel contagious
Am I the only place that you've left to go
She cries her life is like
Some movie black and white
Dead actors faking lines
Over and over and over again she cries

Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away, leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

And I wanted
You turned away
You don't remember, but I do
You never even tried

Don't fall away, leave me to myself

Down south, I see you're bouncin' right 
West coast, I know you're walkin' right 
(You don't know what you mean to me) 
Midwest, you're still swingin' right."
2002,5,Wherever You Will Go,The Calling,"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will

No, run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go"
2002,6,A Thousand Miles,Vanessa Carlton,"Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these 
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me 
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you, oh, oh

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight"
2002,7,In the End,Linkin Park,"(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"

2002,9,U Got It Bad,Usher,"Oh, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found 
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song, then baby

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm-)

Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song

Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm you girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found 
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad, hey

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
(Look at yourself)
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad"
2002,10,Blurry,Puddle of Mudd,"Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doin', imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face

Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
'Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doin', I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Oh, nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to run away

Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to run away

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

No
This pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all, take it all away?
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
This pain you gave to me"

Life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is

Chill out, what you yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool, you look like a fool to me

Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else 
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
You fall and you crawl and you break 
And you take what you get and you turn it into 
Honesty, promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at, you see
You're making me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know you're not foolin' anyone 
When you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool, you look like a fool to me

2002,12,Always on Time,Ja Rule ,"Oh yeah
I'm not always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), but I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my all, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby, you know the game and love is about pain

So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein' me

I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in Gucci shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids

Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fuckin' you all wild
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care 

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather

Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy

I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-Wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered

Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Oh I'm feelin' like ya livin' a double life
'Cause you don't be comin' home sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time 
Checkin' for one time

You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me, baby
I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone

Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious

And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Always there when you call, I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby be mine
Always there when you call,  I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby, be mine

Here at W-I and Z we play nuthin' but da hits
Nuthin' but da hits
Nuthin' but da motha fuckin hits..."
2002,13,Ain't It Funny,Jennifer Lopez ,"Estoy
Loca
Enamorada
De ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be"
2002,14,The Middle,Jimmy Eat World,"Hey, don't write yourself off yet

Don't stop now straight to the top now

(Ginuwine and Mario Winans)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man

(Verse 1: P. Diddy)
Girl you made me believe again
If you happy then be with him, go 'head mommy breathe again
Go 'head mommy breathe again, don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head mommy make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a trifilin mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard cry with me, die with me
White beach sands lye with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
So tight, now I understand life

(Chorus: Ginuwine, Mario Winans &amp; P. Diddy)
What I need

Is a pretty woman next to me

Maybe we could start a family
(Ginuwine: Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

(Verse 2: Loon)
Listen to me now what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day now I want to lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
Cause mommy I've done been around the world, seened a lot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin Sean bless it
So why listen to her and start guessin?
Mommy you ain't ready to ride to start dressin
I need a girl receive my mom's blessin
Confession, my love no contestin
I need affection

[P. Diddy] Yes I need affection, let's go Mario!
(Mario Winans)
Girl what the hell is on your mind
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's somethin' leakin in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me, always did agree
That ain't what I need, baby!

(Ginuwine and Mario Winans)
What I need, is a pretty woman next to me

To share the dreams that I Believe

Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

(Verse 3: P. Diddy)
Ay yo the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever bee to Sandro Pe?
Or seened a brotha play Amando Lay?
Girl I want to just, look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', do I believe in?
Love you till the day I stop breathin, I love you girl

(Chorus: Ginuwine and Mario Winans)
What I need, is a pretty woman next to me
(Ginuwine: Standin next to me girl)

2002,20,My Sacrifice,Creed,"Hello my friend, we meet again
It's been a while, where should we begin?
It feels like forever
Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me
Oh, I remember

When you are with me I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh, how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others we'll fly

2002,21,Without Me,Eminem,"Obie Trice:
Obie Trice - real name, no gimmicks.

Eminem:
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back, back?
Back again, gain, gain
Shady's back, back, back
Tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble

They didn't even cry a river

There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now, nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me coming back for more

Baby, you're all that I want

Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin' it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin

Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words

Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreaming, but till I awake
Can't we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this

He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin'
Oh yes I'm takin', ain't no use in fakin

From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot

Thinkin' of a masterplan, you know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a grand
Now it's kelos to c notes and how fast your grands
We ball like we own the world, your only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin' in tongues
Breathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you try to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin' loot out for lawyers and bail will get you boot out
Just me and you high off sex I'm twisted
You OG'd and you OD addicted

He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous

2002,42,No Such Thing,John Mayer,"""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
""Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white""
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you ""stay inside the lines""
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you ""stay inside the lines""
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for"

2002,45,Can't Get You Out of My Head,Kylie Minogue,"I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

Every night, every day, just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay
Won't you lay
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
Set me free, feel the need in me, set me free
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever

I just can't get you out of my head

2002,46,Superman (It's Not Easy),Five for Fighting,"I can't stand to fly
I'm not that na√Øve
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

I'm more than a bird
I'm more than a plane
More than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd
But don't be na√Øve
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed
But won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up, up and away, away from me
Well it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that na√Øve
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for Kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me
Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me

I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man looking for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy
It's not easy to be me"
2002,47,Cleanin' Out My Closet,Eminem,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of M√ºnchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (yeah)

I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed

As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said at the cost of her name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine
Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to
Rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of Mo√´t for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker, she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it (Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I oh, oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh yeah)
I'm not a man to play around baby (Ooh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat, for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When you're feeling all alone
All you gotta do, is just call me call me

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday

Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall
Well just wait until
Till the sun goes down

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It will steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
Don't you know, don't you know
That you, can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight... No
You can't fight it...
It's gonna get to your heart

There's no escaping love
Once the gentle breeze
Weaves a spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long
Till you're in my arms

Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss

But you know, But you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight... No

2002,63,Lose Yourself,Eminem,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

You can do anything you set your mind to, man."

Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come to see me
You say that you're too busy (What?)

What the hell, I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind?
I can find another guy
Someone who will treat me right

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it, any longer
You can, go if you want
I don't, need your pity

Was that what I heard you say?
Said that you'd love only me
Thought that you'd be all I need (What?)

What happened to promises?
Said that you were a better man
Your words have no weight with me
'Cause you're counterfeit, I see

Now what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with
Now what if I told you the game we play, I picked it
Now what if I said it wasn't true, so do you
You and I know without me there's no you

So what about bills that were past due, paid for you
All you say to me is: ""Baby, I owe you"" (Aha)
Forget about the brand new life that I gave you
Don't what about us to me 'cause we are through

2002,66,Underneath Your Clothes,Shakira,"You're a song, written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong, 'cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes is where I'll find them

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you, I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone, when the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory 
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl 
For being such a hey, hey, hey, hey

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true, Oh babe it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence, lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners, I'm tied up to this feel...

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes, ah wha ho oh woah
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl..."

Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime, tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

We were always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we began to love it (began to love it)
Watchin' all of the heartache and pain of the world
And thinkin' nothin' of it (thinkin' nothin' of it)
And baby, I got a love for you
And I know that you got me, baby

That everything ain't misleadin'
And I kiss the clouds on them rainy days
And smile for you, when the skies are gray
Babe, 'cause I'm a tear drop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord, would you shower my pain
Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel, that can't soar, can't fly
And I mastered it, Lord knows why

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

I feel like an angel
With my broken wings
So I can soar again
Lord, let me in
Baby, through all the passion, the pain, and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin', yeah

Makin' clothes for all of those
That spread the love
And for those who can't take it
Stand up

(Angie M) Oh yeah yeah
(Lil' Mo) Yeay!
(Angie M) Uh, woo! come on, uh
(Lil' Mo) If I can go, with you
(Angie M) Yo, yo, uh

(Verse 1: Angie Martinez)
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin' like leavin' the coast too
Feelin' like leavin' with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

(Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Verse 2: Sacario)
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin' a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

(Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Bridge: Lil' Mo)
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, 'cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

(Martinez Angie)
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin'? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

(Sacario)
And a seat, know why? the window 'cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

(Angie+S)
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

(Sacario)
Go 'head

(Martinez Angie)
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin' to say boo?

(Sacario)
Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

(Martinez Angie)
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

(Sacario)
And the shop's there?

(Martinez Angie)
If they don't got em, they don't make em

((Sacario:) True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

(Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Outro: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly way, like there is no, no tomorrow
And if I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all"

Andre:
Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's raining inside and you're all alone
All alone, yeah

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah da, bah bah bah-da da)

Andre:
Take a little trip, hater, back up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-Ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See, ain't nuttin' changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit, fuck, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggaz workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole, whole world, world

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat runnin like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stone, gatherin' no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast just won't stop

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news

And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah da, bah bah bah-da da)

Big Boi:
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing God's willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is youself, Dre
Set it on the right, and I'll set it on the left, 'cause

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down

2002,71,Underneath It All,No Doubt ,"There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me like
No one else
And behind your dark glasses you're 
You're somethin' else

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been tryin' real hard
And givin' me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad 

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

So many moons that we have seen
Stumblin' back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better, better, better

For real
'Cause underneath it all,
You are my real Prince Charming
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
Anytime you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side to you
And it's a human I adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
Oh no, you're good for me baby
Of that, I'm a sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be...

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me

This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self destruct

Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know

Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together

It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart

Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me

That you needed a change

Was it something I said to make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way,
To make it so that you were right here,
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind

Won't change the fact that you're gone no, no

Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you

Baby, this ain't your typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, ima fuck, you tonight thing
Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, ima leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangsters an hoe's go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me
'Cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky
Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?
And do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama, Dodge and White Rolls
Uh-oh, another episode

That's why they suck dick with mo' passion than average

We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus I freaks off like O-Dog in ""Love Jones""
Been in, many zones, baby one hoes, two hoes
From, prissy bitches to hoes that do porno
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
And got all these hoes, givin' it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, diggin them out, foot on the clutch
Rule baby, not givin' it up

Your whole vibe, like you high on Extasy
'Cause ain't nothin' but an ""E"" thang baby
I know that pussy wet like crazy
I wanna feel your passion, come when you ask me
Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'
But ain't nothin' happenin'
The bitch got a little too high
Picked up my ride and started crackin'
The radio blastin' ""Between Me And You""
But you ain't on the low with that freak thing you do
I thought you knew (What I do)
Know I know (What you do)
'Cause it's been a good night, your head ain't right
Like Teddy P, let's ""Turn Off The Light""
And grind it out, takin' no times out
Till the sun come out

I lose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why),
Because your kisses make my lips quiver (and that's real),

2002,82,The Good Stuff,Kenny Chesney,"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
The corner bar
It just seemed right, so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end, an' lookin' half asleep
But he walked up and said ""What'll it be?""
I said, ""The good stuff""
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kinda went misty
He said, ""You can't find that here

'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin' so much
And it's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
An' eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff""

He grabbed a carton of milk 
And he poured a glass
Then I smiled and said
""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed""
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt sayin' 'I'm a grandpa'
Bein' right there as her time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff""

He said, ""When you get home she'll start to cry
When she says, 'I'm sorry,' say 'So am I'
Look into those eyes so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause thats the good stuff
That's the good stuff"""

Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I opened my eyes and see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night

Well since you came along

2002,86,Drive (For Daddy Gene),Alan Jackson,"It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

When Daddy let me drive

Daddy let me drive

Oh he let me drive

It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson
And electric choke"
2002,87,Standing Still,Jewel,"Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
Try to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here
To the twilight
There's a dead end to my left
There's a burning bush to my right
You aren't in sight
You aren't in sight

Do you want me
Like I want you
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

Mothers on the stoop
Boys in souped-up coupes
On this hot summer night
Between fight and flight
Is the blind man's sight
And a choice that's right
I roll the window down
Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down
Feel broken down

Do you need me
Like I need you?
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

Sweet sorrow is a call tomorrow
Sweet sorrow is a call tomorrow

Do you love me
Like I love you?
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

Oh you're passing me by
Passing me by

Do you need me like I need you to?
Do you want me like I want you?
Or are you passing me by?
Or am I standing still?"

Spend all my time
It's yours whatever is mine...

A new day has come

I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

(Hush, love) I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched
By an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun

Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

Oh, it's almost blinding me

And the day will see
If you will get some

Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I am good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see
Yeah, if you're gonna get some

2002,93,Living and Living Well,George Strait,"Had a nice little life
A little boat, a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

'Til you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish, caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in livin'
I thought I was living
There's a difference in living and living well

Livin' well
I'm livin' well..."
2002,94,My List,Toby Keith,"Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my list of things to do today:
Go to the bank and the hardware store,
Put a new lock on the cellar door.
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done,
But when the sun is settled, there's still more than a few things left
I haven't got to yet.

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Wouldn't change the course of fate,
Cuttin' the grass just had to wait
'Cause I've got more important things
Like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow, what I could get done today

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Raise a little hell, laugh till it hurts,
Put an extra five in the plate at church,
Call up my folks just to chat,
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, and over sleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my List of things to do today."
2002,95,Hands Clean,Alanis Morissette,"If it weren't for your maturity none of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention you wouldn't have been successful and
If it weren't for me you would never have amounted to very much

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're kind of my protege and one day you'll say you learned all you know from me
I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would and I think I like it

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

Just make sure you don't tell on me especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world 'cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might want to marry you one day if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this"
2002,96,Sk8er Boi,Avril Lavigne,"He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rocking on MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

I'm with the skater boy
I said, ""See ya later, boy
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know""

2002,97,Long Time Gone,Dixie Chicks,"Daddy sits on the front porch swingin'
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley tobacco
Now he knows it never will
My brother found work in Indiana
Sister's a nurse at the old folks' home
Mama's still cooking too much for supper
And me, I been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin' back again

Deliah plays that old church piano
Sittin' out on her daddy's farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord, I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singing in the choir
Me I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord I been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
Lord I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin' back again

Now me, I went to Nashville
Trying to be the big deal
Playing down on Broadway
Getting there the hard way

Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I'm gonna be a star

Now me and Deliah
Singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
Listen to the radio to hear what's cooking
But the music ain't got no soul

Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think the rest is

A long time gone
No I ain't hit the roof since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back

I said a long time gone
No I ain't honked a horn since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

I said a long time, long time, long time gone

Whoa, it's been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone

Oh, it's been a long... time... gone
Long time, long time, long time gone"
2002,98,Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning),Alan Jackson,"Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell 
you the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?"
2002,99,Like I Love You,Justin Timberlake,"Just somethin' about you
The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me
Gettin' scared now, right
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right, listen

I kinda noticed something one night,
In the club a frump face,
It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so is datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Yeah
You know I could make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, hold my jacket
And then...

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just want to love you baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby)
Girl...

(Pusha T)
Ma' whatcha wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow'
Point to me I say 'Yeah, it's the same dough'
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night

(Malice)
Do a robbery, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
(I just love your... brain...)
Play number three, Joint called 'Brain'
Ma, take a hint
Make a swerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl...
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl...)

Ain't nobody love you like I love ya
(Can't love ya like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Makes me trust ya like I do, hey)
Late at night I talk to you (hey)
You will know the difference when I...

(Break it down)

You know
I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way
Drums... (hey)

It's kinda special right, yeah
You know, if you think about it
Sometimes people are just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is

Now everybody dance"
2002,100,I Do!!,Toya,"He was a 6 foot stallion say the storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpatatin' every time he came near
He had a spankin new Range sport a tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his hair was corn-rowed
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

'Cause I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

Me and my crew started groovin made our way to the floor
It's time activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me I felt fingertips
On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin' hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this thug my man that I can tell you, for sure

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

'Cause I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Now watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin' all the pappi's want me but all I want is you

(I do)

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Now watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin' all the poppi's want me but all I want is you

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs

But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up

Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm 'aight)

In the hood, in L.A., they saying ""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?

When my jaws get to bumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned

I'm-a tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub

2003,4,Crazy in Love,Beyonc√© ,"Yes
It's so crazy right now
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young

You ready?

Get up, history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

No no
No no
No no
No no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now

2003,5,When I'm Gone,3 Doors Down,"There's another world inside of me
That you may never see
There's secrets in this life
That I can't hide

Well, somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well, maybe it's too far away
Or maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

When your education x-ray
Cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing
That I could not tell my friends

Now roaming through this darkness
I'm alive but I'm alone
Part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone, woah

Staring at the ceiling makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall

All night
Hearing voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

Hold back

Breakdown

But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Me
Talking to myself in public
And dodging glances on the train

And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be something wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sun shine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I saw you yesterday with an old friend
Kid Rock:
It was the same ole same ""how have you been?""
Both:
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

Kid Rock:
You reminded me of brighter days
Sheryl Crow:
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
Kid Rock:
I was off to drink you away

Both:
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home

Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here (There must be something more)
Bring me to life

(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?

If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?

I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers in Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?

And in the bed if I use my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a li'l drink you know a nightcap
And we can go do what you like, I know you like that

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad 'cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing

Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at ya' trying figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

We only humans girl, we make mistakes
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Oh
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah yeah

It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreatin' me
And it's crazy but oh baby
It don't matta whatever do faze me

I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute don't bounce baby, let's talk about this

Well I'm bouncin' and I'm out son 
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good 
Holding down my spot
And I'm good
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

My pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad

The path you chose to run along
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone?

The nights I've waited up for you
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me I was creeping all over town 
I thought my tender touch could lock ya down
I knew I had you as cocky as it sounds

The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you're angry come here I'll prove it now (come here)
Stop playing, you gaming
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good 
Holding down my spot
And I'm good 
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

The path you chose to run along
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you have a home
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone?

People make mistakes, to make up, to break up
To wake up cold and lonely and chill baby, you know me
You love me, I'm like your homie
Instead a-beefing come hold me, I promise I'm not a phony
Don't bounce baby, console me, come here

Ain't nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now, 
Nothin' will ever be the same
So just be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now

And there's no more to explain to me, ya know
I know ya game, I'm not feelin' what you do (and I'm good)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out son (I'm good) 
I gotta leave you alone, yeah yeah

My pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad

2003,16,Beautiful,Christina Aguilera,"Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone, left the puzzle undone
Ain't that the way it is?

'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no, no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (Yeaheah, yeaheah!)
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine!)
And tomorrow we might awake on the other side

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Always busy this busy that

Walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short
How long can you tolerate it

Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

Hey, yo, to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express the words

I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you

Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed

Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old

Went from Lucy's and buses
To fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas
To Lexus to Rovers

Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats

Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

When I'm feelin' blue
The guitars come in through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy you've given me (ooh the joy that you given me)
I want you to know I believe in your song (oh yeah)
Your Rhythm, and rhyme, and harmony (mmmhmm)
You helped me along (makin' me strong), ah you're makin' me strong, oh

But girl, (I'm gonna) do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now?
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou
On Fifth Ave, shopping sprees and them dinners to chow
I ain't concerned with other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous, it's the principle now
I'm so into you

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

Come on ma
It's more than a flashing
I woulda traded it all in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashing
Just off the shore so you can hear when the water be splashing
The Drop top 3 in a quarter we dashing
Flawless diamonds in the water we flashing
The money we oughta be stashing
I make sure every quarter be cashed in

I can't really explain it
My friends be thinking I'm slipping
These girls be thinking I'm tripping
What kinda weed you be smoking
What typa drinks you be sipping
Sweet thing just to think of you dipping
Would have me with the blue so hard
You would think I was cripping
Now you relaxing in the Benz
Credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxing when you spends
But since you been asking about the friends
How'd you like it if both our names had Jackson on the ends

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak
Remind me of them trips to Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it ain't because my whips is ruthless
So sit on chrome, dipped up deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary NVS dipped Jesus is
Other ballers look dumb when they press you
Five and sixes, you don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Being a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, this superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart while the villa being painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it can feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, yeah

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

Oh, no no no no no no
Ooh no no
So into you"
2003,24,Can't Let You Go,Fabolous ,"(Fabolous)
Baby girl
You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitta
When the startin lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassin ya
But it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wonder why he comin' home in the middle of the night
It'll be all right if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be all right c'mon

(Chorus - lil mo)
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go
Your the one I want in my life (want in my life)
Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

(Fabolous)
You ain't ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while on springer
At first you were somethin' I denied
Something I would slide
Just do somethin' in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entre ain't as good without somethin' on the side

(Chrous)

(Fabolous)
Uh oh, I might be leavin' the earth soon
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
It's gonna be a clip toss if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She wont care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely
You seen what happened with mr. big and r kelly

(Lil mo)
You know I care for you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you
Which makes it a lil mo clear for you"

Ja Rule:
I got a fetish for fucking you with the skirt on
On a back street in the back seat of a Yukon
What's taking so long?
I'm getting anxious but patiently waiting for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you we can find a jet to fly aboard in my private g2
I ain't trying to g you ma, I'm trying to see you
Bend over you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to the coldest night So ferocious
Now you street promoting the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed nigga go hard like jordan sweat pouring
Loving the way you be moaning, gripping
The sheets,
Looking at me, Licking at me
Cause every woman just wanna be happy
Its crazy but baby I
[Ashanti] love it when I'm with you baby

Ashanti:

Cause you know like I know
And there's a better day coming
I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me
And when you hold my body
I know you need me
Wait for me baby
I've been going half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better then drugs
Then get addicted *boy listen*

Like when *were* kissing (*bye bye bye*)
You got a girl that'll ride, ride, ride
So take me tonight and do what you do to me baby

All over my body baby"
2003,26,Where Is The Love?,The Black Eyed Peas,"What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)

Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)

Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, all ways are changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?

Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone?

So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover

The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all (come on yeah)

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send us some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)

Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)

Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction

Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images, is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas

Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity

That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself)

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? 

Sing with me y'all:
One world, one world (We only got)
One world, one world (That's all we got)
One world, one world
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah
We only got
(One world, one world)
That's all we got
(One world, one world)"
2003,27,The Game of Love,Santana ,"Tell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss and boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me 
Why don't you come around no more?
'Cause right now I'm 
Cryin' outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm tellin' ya babe it's all in the game of love 

Whatever you make it to be
Sunshine set on this cold, lonely sea
So please baby
Try and use me for what I'm good for
It ain't sayin' good-bye
It's knockin' down the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm tellin' ya babe it's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love

You roll me, control me, console me
Please hold me!
You guide me, divide me into 
Into two

(So please tell me)
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now I'm 
Dying outside the door of your lovin' store
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss now we're up to bat
It little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm telling you my baby it's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love, it's all in the game of love

Roll me, control, me 
Please hold me

I'm out here on my own"
2003,28,Lose Yourself,Eminem,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

You can do anything you set your mind to, man."

2003,31,How You Gonna Act Like That,Tyrese,"It seems like just the other day that we hooked up
(I was drivin', you was walkin' and I swooped you up)
From that moment on, I knew you were the one, yeah
(I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love)

We would sit and talk for hours about anything
(Baby, you hang up, no, you hang up, on three, hang up)
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything
(Said you'd always be my baby, then you bounce)
How you gonna...

How you gonna up and leave me now
How you gonna act like that
How you gonna change it up, we just finished makin' up
How you gonna act like that

How you gonna act like we don't be makin' love
You know, we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget
How you gonna act like that

Girl, I never thought that lovin' you would hurt
(I did everything a good man would to make it work)
Girl, you should've told me you had second thoughts
(Like before I put the down on the house we bought)

Now I'm thinkin' you and me was a mistake
(But then, it hits me and I'm missin' all the love we made)
Girl, I know that we've been goin' through some things, yeah

I'll be the one that misses you
I'll be the one to ease your pain

You ready B? Let's go get 'em...

Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin' down the westside (high, way)
Doing what we like to do (our, way)
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin' - if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin' this Earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin at Hermes, Burking Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (that somebody was me)
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)"

('Cause) I need two pair
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
(Big boy) stompin' in my Air Force Ones

Nelly:
I like the all-white, high-top, strapped with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, they're dirty, that's why I got 'em
I leave them strapped and laced, they come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em, I damn near shot 'em

Kyjuan:
Now if you look and see lime green Forces, it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop, my niggas flip-flop
Yeah my Force Ones in tip-top now form a flip-flops

Ali:
I like the limited edition, the khaki, and army green
Patent leather, pin stripes, you should see how I do the strings
Size 12 with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depends on when and where I'm at

Murphy Lee:
Don't get me wrong, man: Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
'Cause if the shoe is on the shelf you should have some, man
You cannot sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You might not have three or four but you got one, man

10 1/2, and if you got 'em, give me two of those
I can tell she's never seen Murphy Lee befo'
'Cause she just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, ""Excuse me, miss, I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you, Murph, especially in the white and blue""
I said, ""The white and blue? Sounds nice, make it twice""
Then I signed an autograph, ""Thanks for the advice""

Ali:
Yo, I keep it real dirty, dirty, you know how I do
Purple and gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like floppy with ankle socks, lows, mids, and high-tops
With the clear sole but it's Tims and fat laces when is cold
But when the winter go (brr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all-purpose with them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stoppin' this dough that I'm spendin' fo sho'
On them Nike Air Force N-E behind the O

Kyjuan:
Ok, Lee, I treat my shoes like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and the wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh with electric roof
Plus I put a kit on the sole, now I got a wider shoe (ooh)
You see that low misk with the purple coop, I'm driving them
(Kyjuan where you getting them colors, are you dyein' them?)
10 is my size in them, and no point in tyin' them
Ain't no point of trying these on, they know I'm buying them

Nelly:
Now, don't nothing get the hype on first sight like white on whites
Them 3 quarters, the lows, they all tight
The only problem, they only good for one night
'Cause once you scuff 'em, you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis, the looks on store owners' faces
This kid is outrageous, he buying 'em by the cases
'Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all-purpose ya heard me kinda like my Dayton's

I wore spurs at first, now there's tape on 'em
(Damn, when those come out?) So I write the date on 'em
These Louis Vuitton Ones, you gotta wait on 'em
I had to get them early so I spent mo' cake on 'em

Murphy Lee:
Look, I'm trying to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki, two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wilin') fish bowl in the mall
(I got some 15's) security buying shoes and all

Nelly:
Listen, sometimes I get 'em free and sometimes I gotta pay
Walk in the mall, and they know what I'm 'bout say
Gimme the black, and the platinum, and leather gray
The ones in the back and the pair you got on display

Ali:
Now, in the boxes is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should keep buyin' (keep buyin'), once or twice but never 3 times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell-toes
But can't nothing compare to a fresh, cripsy white pair of that

Walk to it, do it how you do it

Little cutie looking like a student
Long hair, with ya big, fat booty
Back in the days you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp pimp-fluid
Mommy don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch ""Clueless""

When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow dro and keep the flow moving
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeaking when we screwing
Now she's yelling, hollering out ""Snoop!"" and
Hooting, hollering; hollering, hooting
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long, think, black, and curly like you're Cuban
Keep grooving, that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in

But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone

You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you in
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue and... (Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you...)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you

Who gon roll up in the club and then report that next week
Just wanna see who I am fucking boy
Sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line I'm a hear this on the radio

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not from tumors
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight
Hard to the core
Core to the right
Drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton

Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know I know, I don't even care about her being preganant by Michael Jackson
You know what we should do
We should go get her album when it comes out
There she go, there she go, there she
Hey Missy

Hi Missy?
What's up fools?
You think I ain't knowin' y'all broke Milli Vanilli
Jay Jay fan wannabes ain't over here gossiping 'bout me?
Yo how 'bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents so your lights wont get cut off
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs
Yo take those baby GAP shirts off, too
You just mad 'cause Payless ran out of plastic pumps for the after party
Yo by the way, go get my album

Miss Keep Your Distance, mm
Miss Unafraid, Miss Out of My Way
Miss Don't Let a Man Interfere, no
Miss On Her Own, Miss Almost Grown
Miss Never Let a Man Help Her Off Her Throne

So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never, ever feel rejected
Little Miss Apprehensive
I said ooh, she fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

Miss Guarded Heart, Miss Play It Smart
Miss If You Wanna Use That Line You Better Not Start, no
But she miscalculated, she didn't wanna end up jaded
And this Miss decided not to miss out on true love, so

By changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found in time she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to Miss No Longer Afraid?

It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""Why can't that be me?""
I'm so glad I finally see

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love, when love is true

2003,45,Calling All Angels,Train,"I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake from the words that I said

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

And I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

When children have to play inside so they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies 'cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens and losing sight of having dreams
In a world where all we want is only what we want until it's ours

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
And I'm calling all angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
And I'm calling all you angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels

2003,47,This Is the Night,Clay Aiken,"When the world wasn't upside down
I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait
When a moment can vanish so fast
'Cause every kiss
Is a kiss you can never get back

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

When the answer to all my dreams
Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here
Holding back what I'm trying to say

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right

Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

This is the night where we capture forever
And all our tomorrows begin
After tonight
We will never be lonely again

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right

Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this

2003,48,Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling
Towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder

Walking round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Mmmm, and it's all right
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied (turns out)
Everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Mmmm, And it's all right
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down

So I say why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

And slowly I begin to realize this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by and I say
Oh, here we go again, Ooh...

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied (turns out)
Everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

So I'll say why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in"

Everybody's like, 'He's no item. Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!'
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
With a flashy nigga braggin on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2 ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in the matrix
Fuck it, let the Fish-burn
Red or green pill, you live and you learn. C'mon!

Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'

[If I work hard at it] (If I work hard at it)
[I'll be where I wannna be] (I'll be where I wanna be)

B, b boys and girls listen up,
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust,
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothin' comes easy it takes much practice,
Like I met a woman who was becoming a star,
She was very beautiful leaving people in awe.
Singin' songs, later on, but the younger version,
Hung wit' the wrong person, got her stunger than heroine,
Cocaine, sniffin' up drugs all in her nose,
Could've died so young, now looks ugly and old,
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death,
Watch the company you keep, and the crowd you bring,
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing,
So if you gonna be the best I'm'a tell you how,
Put your hands in the air and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be what I wanna be)
[I know I can] (I know I can)
[Be what I wanna be] (Be what I wanna be)
[If I work hard at it] (If I work hard at it)
[I'll be where I wanna be] (I'll be where I wanna be)

B, b, boys and girls listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten.
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the clubs with fake ID.
Careful 'fore you meet a man with HIV.
You can host a TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow,
You're thinking he can give you wealth but so
Young boy, you could use a lot of help you know
Ya thinkin' life's all about smokin' weed and ice.
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write,
Beggin' different women for a place to sleep at night.
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish.
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be what I wanna be)
[I know I can] (I know I can)
[Be what I wanna be] (Be what I wanna be)
[If I work hard at it] (If I work hard at it)
[I'll be where I wanna be] (I'll be where I wanna be)

B, be'fore we came to this country,
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.
There was empires in Africa called Kush,
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold; When
Gold was converted to money it all changed,
Money then became empowerment for Europeans.
The Persian military invaded,
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked,
Slavery was money, so they began making slaveships.
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was in shock that in the mountains were black faces.
Shot off their nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today you see.
If the truth is told the youth can grow.
They'll learn to survive, until they gain control.
Nobody says you have to be gangsters, hoes.
Read more, learn more, change the globe.
Ghetto children do your thing.
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king.
Young princess when you get your wedding ring,
Your man is saying, ""She's my queen!""

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be what I wanna be)
[I know I can] (I know I can)
[Be what I wanna be] (Be what I wanna be)
[If I work hard at it] (If I work hard at it)
[I'll be where I wanna be] (I'll be where I wanna be)

2003,59,Underneath It All,No Doubt ,"There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me like
No one else
And behind your dark glasses you're 
You're somethin' else

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been tryin' real hard
And givin' me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad 

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

So many moons that we have seen
Stumblin' back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better, better, better

For real
'Cause underneath it all,
You are my real Prince Charming
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
Anytime you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side to you
And it's a human I adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
Oh no, you're good for me baby
Of that, I'm a sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be...

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me

If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?

But I know you are here with me now

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away 
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through 
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
I hope, I love you all my life

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight you know my heart is by your side

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand

We do this all tha time, right now we on tha grind
So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes

Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin with they mind
I make 'em press rewind

They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

Damn Homie, in high school you was tha man, homie

And if you play wit my paper, you gotta meet my berretta

Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta
I'm livin once than deada, I know I can do better
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her

Be easy, stop tha bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step
Guerilla unit 'cause, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'

Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm jus me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

'Cause I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat

Niggas sayin they goin murder 50, how?
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR 15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'

2003,67,Can't Hold Us Down,Christina Aguilera ,"So, what am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two

That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls? (Shout louder!)

Letting 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will

So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended with the message I'm bringing
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all, the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore

I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it and the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
What do we do girls? (Shout louder!)

Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Check it

Now here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, or sex her off
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore

But the table's about to turn, I'll bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it
It's all right though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'

To my girls to their man who be trying to Mac
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

But you're just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things

So you're just a little boy
All you do is annoy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things (This is for my girls!)

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls? (Shout louder!), shout louder

Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Ohoho, ooh)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

This is for my girls all around the world (For my girls)
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth (Around the world!)
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard (Yeaheah)
So what do we do girls? (Shout louder!)

Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand my ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Ohoho)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Spread the word
Can't hold us down

Yeah
We here
Be back again
Yeah, Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera

Yeah
Can't hold us down!"

2003,69,Angel,Amanda Perez,"It's been five months
Since you went away
Left without a word,
Nothing to say (nothin' to say)
When I was the one,
Who gave you my heart and soul,
But it wasn't good enough for you
No... Oh oh oh oh
So I asked God


God send me an Angel
From the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart,
From being in love,
'Cause all I dooo... is cry (is cry)
God send me an Angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

And I know it might sound crazy,
But after all that I still loved you.
You wanna come back in my life,
But now there's something I have to do.
I have to tell the one that I once adored,
That they can't have my love no more,
My heart can't take no more lies,
And my eyes are all out of cries
So... God

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please
To send you back to me
I couldn't eat
I couldn't sleep
You even made me feel like I could not breathe
When I... all I wanted to do
Was feel your touch
And to give you all of my love
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now
But you can't have it
Oh God!

Oh God!

Send me an Angel (send me an angel)
An Angel!
Wipe the tears from my eyes
God send me an Angel from the Heavens above
Sent me an Angel (to heal my broken heart)
God send me an Angel
From being in love
Send me (an Angel)
Oh God!
Send me an Angel
Send me (an Angel)
(An Angel)"
2003,70,She Hates Me,Puddle of Mudd,"Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who would slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt, not feeling pain, no

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

That's my story, as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it's over and I'm glad
'Cause I'm a fool for all I've said

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love
Trust
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love

I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it... four years down the drain
Oh how I wish things would of happened so differently
I try'd to save us so many times but still you couldn't see
U kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again
And now you tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
And ur tryin' to come back home
Ur tellin' me you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
But baby i

Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
U keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight and say the things
That hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try don't wanna try I 'bout just had enough it's been a rough road
Baby just let it go
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

U and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up face reality
It all just seem to good to be true after all you put me through
And now you tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
And you tryin' to come back home
U tellin' me that you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor

I'm sittin' in my truck, snakin' the club out,
Kill this sip then go wild the f*** out,
Up in the club with my hands in the air,
There's so much shit in the atmosphere,
So girl, quit frontin' and get you're ass over here,
And get yourself a cup of this Crown and Belvedere,

Hosted by Sonia and Monya, ooh,

2003,75,Beer for My Horses,Toby Keith ,"Well a man come on the 6 o'clock news
Said somebody's been shot, somebody's been abused
Somebody blew up a building
Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn't get too far yeah
They didn't get too far

Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree, round up all of them bad boys
Hang them hign in the street for all the people to see that

Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
We'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send 'em all to their maker and he'll settle 'em down
You can bet he'll set 'em down 'cause

Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
We'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road
I'm already blowed, hit third I'm a be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like wassup
I told 'em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said ain't you that boy that be on BET?
Yeah that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in herre, I heard 'em whispering
Talking bout that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' keep listenin

Ma showed up like what's the hold up?
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk, actin' silly
The girl said can I be in yo video I'm like yeah!, oh really?
Now she naked stripteasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told OG, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wildin
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin' like they from an island

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Verse 3: Ludacris)
Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little D and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Outro: Snoop Dogg)
Yeah, let the party begin, bitch
Ching-a-ling Ling, all the way in St. Louis

Bring a gang of that Hen, some DSOP
Oh wee, and light that sticky icky

Way back
Ooh...
Way back, yeah

I met him when I was a
A little girl, he gave
He gave me poetry
And he was my first

But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
'Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the

Love of my life
You are my friend (yeah)
Love of my life
I can depend

Love of my life
Without you, baby
It feels like I sampled true love
But the shit didn't clear

Hot dam and I can't be stopped 'cause I'm lyte MC and I'm light as a rock
Well my name is Badu and I rock your world, I'm also known as the
Gucci girl. Well I'm super cute and play ain't bad
30 26 36 and 1/2.
Hope you realize
I got them hazel eyes that'll hypnotize
Knock you to yo knees
Make you eat cheese
You be so helpless you be beggin me please

A freak-freak, y'all, and ya don't stop
To the beat y'all and ya don't stop
A freak-freak

How could it be that it was
All just so simple then
A teen age lover who said
He's just a friend

He moved around and we kept
In touch through his friend Mike
The world was young and he knew
We couldn't rush but

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the

Love of my life

On you I can depend, yeah, yeah

Love of my life
Without you, baby
Feels like I sampled true love, yeah

But the shit didn't clear

Y'all know how I met her
We broke up and got back together
To get her back I had to sweat her
Thought she roll with bad boys forever in many ways
Them boys may be better, to grow I had to let her (Never)
She needed cheddar and I understood that
Lookin' for cheese, that don't make her a hood rat
(Rat)
In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me
I love it when she sings to me
It's like that now

You know you rock my world and
Love of my life
You be boy and I'll be girl and

2003,79,Fighter,Christina Aguilera,"After all you put me through
You think I'd despise you
But in the end I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
I guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up, 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joyride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But, oh, oh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Oho, oho
Oho, oho
Ohohoho, yeaheaheah
Aha

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game

I heard you're going around
Playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hurt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, aha, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies
Disguise yourself through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gonna stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Thought I would forget
But I, I remember, ohohohoho
Yes, I remember, ohoho
I remember!

Thought I would forget, ooohooohooo
I remember, ohoho
Yes, I remember, ohoho!
I remember!

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
Thanks for making me a fighter"
2003,80,Thugz Mansion,2Pac,"Tupac:
Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion

Tupac:
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would have tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'

(Chorus: Anthony Hamilton)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the sky...
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the sky...

2Pac:
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion


2Pac:
Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, till the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'"
2003,81,Clocks,Coldplay,"The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are
You are

Oh, nothing else compares

Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evil Kinevil scars
On my right arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried

It was 1970-something
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Faucett hair-do days
Bell bottoms and 8-track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1970-something

It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
Dad broke down and finally shaved
Them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubix cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A Space Shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1980-something

Now I got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish sometimes
Sometimes...

2003,86,Red Dirt Road,Brooks & Dunn,"I was raised off of rural route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
And race barefoot back to Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned the corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

Her daddy didn't like me much
In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
And drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
It feels like I found a long lost friend

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road."
2003,87,What Was I Thinkin',Dierks Bentley,"Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?

She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinkin'?

Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'?

I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'

Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... 'cause I was

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'"
2003,88,Flying Without Wings,Ruben Studdard,"Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You have found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

But for me, it's waking up beside you, yeah
To watch the sun rise on your face
To know that I can say ""I love you""
At any given time or place

It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine, all mine
And it's the flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

You're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy it brings
I'm flying without wings"
2003,89,Sing for the Moment,Eminem,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Chorus from Aerosmith's Dream On)
(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus

But music is reflection of self, we just explain it
And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away"
2003,90,Have You Forgotten?,Darryl Worley,"I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start your preaching let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away


Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost and those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry about bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?"
2003,91,"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems",Kenny Chesney,"I've been up to my neck, working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles, of the shoes on my feet
Been dreamin' of getting away, since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now, for Mexico

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand, with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems

Want a towel or a chair, in the sand by the sea
Wanna look through my shades, and see you there with me
Wanna soak up life for awhile, and lay back low
No boss no clock no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand, with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, no problems

Babe let's get packed, tank tops and flip-flops, if you got 'em
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems"

Man, it's about this fishy (I'm so confused)
'Cause I ain't even did shit
My wife ain't hit me on my pager or cell
And when I CALL HER, I keep gettin' the damn voice mail
What's goin' on? Yeah I know I'm wrong
For goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'
Hopin' ya ""Home Alone"" like Caulkin
But I picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected

(Chorus w/ad libs)

I'm so sick of bein' lon-
Ah, don't finish yo statement
You alone call me, I'll be yo replacement
Put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go
Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
'Cause ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a plate of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
'Cause I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'
Something so pretty as you at home alone
That's unbelieveable, like when the cow jumped over the moon
Now, I never put nothin' before you
That's like eatin' cereal, pickin' a fork over a spoon

Don't know why I didn't come

Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come, I
Don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come"

You high baby? (Yeah)
Yeah? (Ha ha ha. Talk to me.)
You want me to tell you somethin'? (Uh huh)
I know what you wanna hear



'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you, too
(I think I love you baby)
I think I love you, too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you, too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy)
Bitch, you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down

In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face

I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass

Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, copin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Am I too nice to buy you ice?
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be my new wife?
What you Mariah, fly through twice?

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman

I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what
That's about as far as your buddy goes

We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then

You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie

But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though

You're just plain old Marshall to me)

Ooh yeah girl run that game

Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot in Pieces"", uhh that's great)

First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool

There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy-wody you must be
Gone off that quarter bottle

You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands

Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday

Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Cept to do the best I can
I'll be damned

I may be a real bad boy

How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Let's drink, you the one to please

2004,3,If I Ain't Got You,Alicia Keys,"Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again 
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before

Bad is when you capable of beating the bag

I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet
But I'm getting better at it

Matter of fact
Let me tell it to you once more again
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't one chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom bada bam bam bam
(You think I'm payin' for it?)

Ciara:
You're insulating that, I'm hot
But these goodies boy are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number

But to give you part two of my confessions

Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it

The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

These are my confessions

When, what and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with

I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby

Dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&amp;B and I got to leave

And unpack your suitcase

But don't think it's too late

That we could end up saying 
Things we've always needed to say 
So we could end up staying

Just like a paperback novel 
Let's rewrite an ending that fits 
Instead of a Hollywood horror 

Nothing's wrong 
Just as long as you know that someday I will 
Someday, somehow 

I'm gonna make it alright 
But not right now 
I know you're wondering when 
You're the only one who knows that 
Someday somehow 

I'm gonna make it alright 
But not right now 
I know you're wondering when 
You're the only one who knows that

How the hell'd we wind up like this, 
And why weren't we able, 
To see the signs that we missed? 
And try to turn the tables

2004,19,My Immortal,Evanescence,"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Me
Me"

(Lea) Uh
(Lil' Flip) Yeah
(Lea) Oh, oh, oh, oh baby
(Lil' Flip) Lil' Flipper (Lil' Flipper)
(Lea) Ooh baby
(Lil' Flip) My girl Lea (my girl Lea) hit it

(Chorus: Lea)
Sunshine
I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time (some time)
I can be your sunshine!
I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time (some time)
I can be your sunshine!

(Verse 1: Lil' Flip)
Look, I know you wanna chill wit a player
But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
'Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll 'cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

(Chorus: Lea)

(Verse 2: Lil' Flip)
I know your friends wanna holla 'cause I got them dollars
Push the Maybach Monday, Tuesday Impala
I switch whips like kicks I'm a balla (I'm a balla)
And if I get your phone number I'm a call ya (I'm a call ya)
And we can meet up the next day and chill
But I'm always on the road baby girl, that's how I live
I got bills to pay, I got moves to make
But when my plane touch down, pick me up at 8:00, don't be late

(Chorus: Lea)

(Verse 3: Lea)
We don't have to be in love (love)
We can just be friends!
I will be right there, beginning to the end!
I can bring my girls (girls), you can bring your friends (friends)
We can both have fun, don't want this stuff to end!

(Verse 4: Lil' Flip)
They say love is pain and pain is love
I know ya Momma mad cause you talk to a thug
You think you know my type but you ain't got no clue
About - what a nigga like me do
I like to stack my bread and flip my chips
And I can change ya life if ya get wit Flip
I take private jets to Vagas, man
It's twenty bread each pick 'cause I'm major man
We can cruise the world in a Bently Azure
But don't worry, the chauffeur open the door
You couldn't ask for more 'cause we got it all (we got it all)
Cause you my baby girl right?, right?

(Chorus: Lea)

(Outro: Lea)
We don't have to be in love (love)
We don't have to be in love (love)"

I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin' my balls
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin', off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops

Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

Spencow, baby

Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talking, why not make him wait for you?
(If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you)

Take your time and feel him out
When it's a good boy
I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?

That's when you give it to him good

Roll it all around, throw it out like your back broke

It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old

And you're thinking of leaving but give it time)

It's late at night, he's coming home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hair, let him know what's on

You know I drop the top and hop that thing
Sometimes I stop my bop to pop my things

You sure know how to make a man say ""Oh""
And how in the world can a man say ""No""
When you grind it up on the wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi Lime it up till you fall

Line it up till you spoiled
And have them other chicks throwin', vomit it up
When they can find it up in the mall
Like most men, I like to catch up with a model
But I ain't used to movin' slow like ketchup in a bottle

The best things come to those who wait for it
But I'm-a be straight forward before it's too late for it
But I want you to dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, throw it out and make me say ""Oh""

It was weird how we met, huh
She was wit her mom in Bank America
I'm wit my son cashin the check
So I asked outta respect (uh)
Would she like to explore the world up high
We can fly in my jet
Her reply was Yes, can I ask you somethin'?
I seen it in her eye, mama lookin' like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (that ain't true) but it was something
About this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual; walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinkin' smart (smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush
To touch, crush and be up, but baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up, we can talk
Conversate about political subjects whatever's thought
So I zoomed off, lookin' by and my phone rang
It was her in the shower, (she said) she said I couldn't do without ya
Then I said...

(Chingy)
The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playing ball
Here she comes wit her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showing off, tryna dunk tryna dribble break fast
Through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approched her wit a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys lookin' at me sayin' Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess wit it, please don't
Told her I'm going home she asked can she go too
I'm like Yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr, I took a shower jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong said I looked at her and said...

Get to rollin' wit me baby, hop in there's enough room
We can gaze at the stars that shine like the moon
Gimme a chance to show ya, and a chance to know ya
Just be true, and there's nothing I won't do, for ya
Some women like to play it foul (foul)
But them the kind I put in the place of a child (child)

I can't believe I fell for your schemes I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women

Because I realized I got

Me, Myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I will be my own best friend

So controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know

Jerk you like a chicken, when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switching to freaky, so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And every time I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at 106 and Park
I can see your beauty, on the big screen
I can see me freaking you, with whip cream
I can see you on stage, at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's, and doing big things

2004,33,Numb,Linkin Park,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly; afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

She always belonged to someone else

And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times 
But somehow, I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah

Know all of the things that make you who you are

Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

2004,36,White Flag,Dido,"I know you think that I shouldn't still love you or tell you that
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it, where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble, I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of ""it's over""
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet, which I'm sure we will
All that was there will be there still
I'll let it pass and hold my tongue
And you will think that I've moved on

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And by Wednesday, I can't sleep

And the darkness is a clear view

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody, I'm messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care
When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, it's your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away

Yeah

And by Tuesday, I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus

They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone till November, I got packs to move, I hope

Kanye West:
(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

I know he hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

Fucked around and got locked up

Oh when it all

Kanye West:
Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Kanye West:
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We-a buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

2004,50,With You,Jessica Simpson,"The real me is a southern girl
With her Levis on and an open heart
Wish I could save the world
Like I was Supergirl

The real me used to laugh all night
Lyin' in the grass just talkin' bout love
But lately I've been jaded
Life got so complicated

I start thinkin' about it
I almost forgot what it was like
To know what love feels like

But with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me
Right before I hit the ground

With nothin' but a t-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke
Just meant for us to know

I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me

'Cause I start thinkin' about it
I almost forgot what it was like
To know when it feels right

'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me
Right before I hit the ground

With nothin' but a t-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you

With you with you with you

Come and take me
Love you, save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself with you

I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me
Right before I hit the ground

With nothin' but a t-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you"
2004,51,Meant to Live,Switchfoot,"Fumbling his confidence and wondering why the world has passed him by
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments and failed attempts to fly, to fly

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

Dreaming about providence and whether mice and men have second tries
Maybe we've been living with our eyes half open, maybe we're bent and broken, broken

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than the wars of our fathers
And everything inside screams for second life
Yeah

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?

We were meant to live

We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin hot
We on fire
Shawty take it off if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire
(Nigga wutchu say?)
We gettin' loose in this muh'fucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire

(Verse 1 - LLoyd Banks)
Naw I ain't puttin' nuttin' out, I smoke when I wanna
26 inch chrome spokes on a Hummer
This heat gon' last for the whole summer
Runnin' your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buyin diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin is your hair
Yeah, I'm ridin' with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists gettin' wrong deals
I'm only 21, sittin' on mill's

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin hot

(Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks)
If you know anythin' about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I 'ont hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm tryna play, you tryna have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care 'bout what the next nigga bought her
'Cause I ain't puttin' no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend' quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't biast when I'm ridin' through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&amp;B diva
Bitch say somethin', I ain't a mind reader

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin hot
We on fire
Shawty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot

She said, ""Pardon me, are you ballin'?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like like like a prostitute"", pausing
Oh, so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek a quick way to eat
A neat place sleep, a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No-go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless

And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom

Just to be back with my baby

Feel like I just walked right out of heaven
Feel like I have damn near threw my life away, hey yeah yeah

Don't know what to do feel like I just walk right out of heaven

See my mamma told me
That's if its meant to be
She'll come back and she'll forgive me
And the best thing I can do is to just
Let her, let her go, I know, I don't wanna do it
But if I continue to push
She'll just pull away
And I know that in my heat it's a reality
I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated,
And I hope that she's not gone for good (no no no)

2004,59,My Band,D12,"Spoken:
I don't know, dude...
I think everybody's all jealous and shit...
'Cause, I'm like, the lead singer of a band, dude...
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me, dude...
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because...



These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

Eminem:
So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby
They're all like ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fuckin' God, it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God, dude, you fuckin' rock
Please won't you please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my A Capella's
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Because I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, baby yeah!

Swifty: Alright, ok,  alright man, give me that mic man, ok, daw...gi...come on..
Eminem: Dude!
Swifty: Give me this mic!
Eminem: Ah, dude?

Swifty:
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
Hey dad how come we don't rap off Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no, I'm Swift (""Oh, I thought you was Kuniva"")
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room?
Cause our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, (uh-huh) it's simple but,
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back

Kuniva and Kon Artis:
Kuniva: Look at Em, little punk ass, thinkin' he the shit
Kon: Yeah, I know, man, by himself takin' on a flick
Kuniva: Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
Eminem: No I had an interview, not you two
Kuniva: You gonna be late for sound check
Kon: Man I ain't goin' to sound check
Kuniva: Man our mics are screwed up
Kon: And his always sound best.. You know what man I'ma say somethin'
Kuniva: Hey yo, Em
Eminem: You got somethin' to say
Kon: Man, nothin'
Kuniva: I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man, what's up
Kon: Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it man shut up. And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
Kuniva: Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Kon: Man, whatever
Kuniva: I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band,
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands,
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man,
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

Proof:
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Hey yo, what's....)
Ready to snap on a dumb ass fan
Every time I hear
""Hey dude, I love your band""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys actin' funny every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag)
Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(""Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!"")

Bizarre:
God dammit, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
""But what about Eminem?""
Bitch, are you retarded
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute
""Hey sexy""
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up (Uhh!)
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout start a group with the real Roxanne

Eminem:
Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

Man, fuck this
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (ha ha)
But they all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer...
My Band
My Band (The Band)
My Band (Our Band)
My Band (The Band)
My Band (You Man)
My Band (You Man)
My Band (Roxanne)
My Band (Shantan)
My Band (Lets do it)

The hottest boy band in the world... D12!

Eminem:
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa (wooo ohhh), look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa

Where'd everybody go?"

2004,62,Why?,Jadakiss,"(Jadakiss)
Aha
It's dat real
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in dept
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if there part of your set
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yeah, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin' down
Why they sellin' niggaz CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my niggaz ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill Tupac 'n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why

(Chorus: Anthony Hamilton)
All that I been givin'
Is this thing that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why, oh why
Why they do me like that

(Jadakiss)
Why would niggaz push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggaz get degreez in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggaz lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggaz can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least

(Jadakiss)
Uh, yeah, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, 'cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a why lie I need a beer sign
Why all the young niggaz is dyin'
'Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
'Cause I got all my old ones
That's why"

I slowly turned left and there you stood
You and your friends talking
But when I eyes connect I knew then
It was just like two waves on beat
I'm your king, be my queen
And what do you want to do tonight
My truck is parked out front, so lets ride

I can read you mind baby
And I know what your thinking
But it's all right (with me baby), it's all right (with me) baby (x2)

So baby take a ride with me
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pouring down
Then all the love that's lost will be found
I'll make your mind lose control
Over your body, that's my goal
So baby just come and down here
Just let the gravity pull you near

I know you wanna rub
I know you wanna touch
I know you wanna feel
So baby keep it real

I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my b-e-d
Grinding slowly (breathing)

I wanna LOVE baby
I wanna feel you

It's like everyone left but you and me

In our own little world
The music is the sun
The dance floor becomes the sea
Feels like true paradise to me

Baby boy you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams (see you in my dreams)

Baby boy not a day goes by
Without my fantasies (bye bye bye bye)
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams (see you in my dreams)

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Baby boy, you are so damn fine
Baby boy, won't you be mine
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel

2004,73,On the Way Down,Ryan Cabrera,"Sick and tired of this world
There's no more air
Tripping over myself, going nowhere
Waiting, suffocating, no direction
I took a dive and

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

Been wondering why it's only me
Have you always been inside waiting to breathe
It's all right, sunlight on my face
I wake up and yet, I'm alive 'cause

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

I was so afraid of going under
But now, the weight of the world
Feels like nothing, no nothing
(Down, down, down)
You're all I wanted
(Down, down, down)
You're all I needed
(Down, down, down)
You're all I wanted
You're all I needed

And I won't forget the way you loved me
All that I wanted, all that I needed now

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you"
2004,74,Breakaway,Kelly Clarkson,"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But, when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Breakaway

2004,75,Why Don't You & I,Santana ,"Since the moment I spotted you
Walking round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Mmmm, and it's all right
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied (turns out)
Everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Mmmm, And it's all right
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied (turns out)
Everything I say to you

Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

And slowly I begin to realize this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by and I say
Oh, here we go again, Ooh...

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied (turns out)
Everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say why don't you and I get together

2004,79,Breaking the Habit,Linkin Park,"Memories consume like opening the wounds
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way; I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight"

And when we parking lot pimping, they surrounding the car
No, I'm NOT tryna be ya man, pimp bones in my body
Rock them body-hotty, rock them, like ladi-dadi
Me and Kels on ducatis, wanna see you drop it shawty
Oh weee, tryna leave the club
Wit a groupie, wit a groupie

I'm a gigolo, spending lots a dough
You can tell the way wide-body, sitting on vogues
And how I'm shining, wit the fresh, fresh clothes
Always surrounded, by so many (HO!)
I'm a gigolo, always on the go
Everytime I turn around, I got another show
In the club, hit about three in a row
Drop in the Six, 'cause I love them (HO!)

Mami, when we leave the club, leave wit us
You don't need ya car keys, we gon' fair in the bus
And the way you wear ya jeans, is means to cuss
So damn!, how you get them on, damn! big secrets on her
Throwback chick, hotter than Ms. Vic Damone
This the type of ... I'm on, not picking up the phone
Unless you unblock ya joint, then put on ya coat
Know when to hit, when Nick get in the booth
Come through in something new, wit the invisible roof
Oh the settings on my necklace them invisible too...
When we do what we do, we can't be visible boo
The last thing I need is lawsuits, all I did is call you
Initiated first move, shorty that was all you
I'm not tryna be ya man, pimp bones in my body
Rock them body-hotty, rock them, like ladi-dadi
Me and Kels on ducati's, wanna see you drop it shawty, oh weee

I'm a gigolo, spending lots a dough
You can tell the way wide-body, sitting on vogues
And how I'm shining, wit the fresh, fresh clothes

2004,81,Live Like You Were Dying,Tim McGraw,"He said, ""I was in my early 40s
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the X-rays
And talking 'bout the options, and talking 'bout
Sweet time
I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man, what'd ya do""
And he said

""I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying""
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

He said, ""I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well, I, I finally read the Good Book
And I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then

I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named
Fumanchu,
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying""
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

Like, tomorrow was a gift
And you got eternity to think about what'd you do
With it
What did you do with it?
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?

Skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named
Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""
Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'"
2004,82,Remember When,Alan Jackson,"Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still, and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried, remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt, remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each others hearts, remember when

Remember when, the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up, remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now, lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again, remember when

Remember when we said, when we turn gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had 
And we'll remember when

Remember when
Remember when"
2004,83,Everytime,Britney Spears,"Notice me, take my hand 
Why are we strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 

Every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done? 
You seem to move on easy 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 

At night, I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby"

2004,86,Wanna Get to Know You,G-Unit ,"(Intro/Chorus: Joe)
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna thug you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

(Verse One: Young Buck)
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes, swangin them hips when you pass
I'm visualizin my name tattooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
She got me feelin' like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasin the chickenhead, you're on somethin'
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good thangs don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showin me that thong
Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy

(Verse Two: Lloyd Banks)
Now bitches be frustrated with a baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nuttin more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin and movin, cruisin after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her friend
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surroundin me, houndin me, tryin' to be my ON-LY
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MEY

(Verse Thre: 50 Cent)
Yeah
Don't know what fuck me up more, watchin her lick her lips
Or watchin her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips man
I sweet talk her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours
Big house, big Benz, girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got ta look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
Cause to me some bunny's gon' hate you that never saw you
C'mere, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night, we can have a baller night

(Chorus) - repeat 2X w/ variations"

(Verse 1: Chingy)
Peeps called me up {*phone ring*} said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor its already eight shawties
I'm on my way (way) let me stop by the store
Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road
I'm already blowed, hit third I'm a be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like wassup
I told 'em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said ain't you that boy that be on BET?
Yeah that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in herre, I heard 'em whispering
Talking bout that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' keep listenin
I ain't come to talk (talk) I ain't come to sit (sit)
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon hit awww shit

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Verse 2: Chingy)
Ma showed up like what's the hold up?
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk, actin' silly
The girl said can I be in yo video I'm like yeah!, oh really?
Now she naked stripteasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told OG, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wildin
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin' like they from an island

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Verse 3: Ludacris)
Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little D and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Outro: Snoop Dogg)
Yeah, let the party begin, bitch
Ching-a-ling Ling, all the way in St. Louis
My nigga Chingy, Disturbing Tha Peace
Luda, Luda, going hard on you hoes
Yeah bitch, bring four of ya friends
Meet me at the Holidae In
Bring a gang of that Hen, some DSOP
Oh wee, and light that sticky icky
And we gone do the damn thing
Know what I'm talking bout
We gon' disturb the peace right now
Yeah we ain't doing nothing but chillin'
And chillin' ain't nuttin'
Know what I'm talking bout, so push the button

You can hide in Atlanta
You can hide in St. Louis"

Cold drink chillin' in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light
Restin' up for a long, long night.

'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.
Yeah!

All day long just takin' it easy
Layin' in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleepin' off the night before
'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more.

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.

This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
The sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play.

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water

2004,90,American Soldier,Toby Keith,"I'm just trying to be a father
Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone
Up and at 'em bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
Yeah, I'm dressed for success
From my head down to my boots

I don't do it for money
There's bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory
I just do it anyway
Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah I'm real good under pressure
Being all that I can be

And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekend's been too strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long
You can bet that I stand ready
When the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady
Hey I'm true down to the core

And I will always do my duty
No matter what the price
I've counted up the cost
I know the sacrifice
Oh, and I don't want to die for you
But if dyin's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
'Cause freedom don't come free

I'm an American soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters
I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy
I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines
Sleep in peace tonight
American soldier
I'm an American soldier

Yeah, an American soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters
I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy
I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines

(Sexy sexy) I know y'all miss the bounce
Y'Need the bounce for the sexy you know
Let's get it in...

(Verse 1: Jay-Z)
Yeah ma, your dude is back,
The Maybach roof is back
Tell the whole world the truth is back
You ain't got to argue about who could rap
Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps
New York, New York! yeah where my troopers at?
Where my hustlers? where my boosters at?
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued you back to the wall
You gotta brawl through that
I been through that,
Been shot at shoot back
Gotta keep it peace like a buddhist
I ain't a New Jack nobody 'gon Wesley Snipe me
It's less than likely, move back
Let I breathe Jedi knight
The more space I get the better I write
(Oh) Never I write, but, if, ever I write
I need the space to say whatever I like, now just

Uh huh yeah, uh (Now girl I promise you, no substitution) It's just me

(Verse 2: Jay-Z)
And I 'gon tell you again let's get ghost in the Phantom
You could bring your friend we could make this a tandem
You could come by yourself and you could stand him
Best believe I sweat out weaves,
Give afropuffs like R.A.G.E.
""Ha-u-git""* if you could move it
Back it on up like a U-Haul truck
Then run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi now shit
He and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music
He is to the east coast what Snoop is,
To the west coast what Face is to Houston
Young Hov in the house it's so necessary
No bra with the blouse it's so necessary
No panties and jeans that's so necessary
Now why you frontin on me? is that necessary?
Do I, to you, look like a lame
Who don't understand a broad with a mean shoe game
Whose up on Dot Dot Dot and Vera Wang
Ma are you insane? let's just
(Woman speaking: What you want me to do?)

(Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell))

Young Hovi in the house it's so necessary
No bra with that blouse it's so necessary
No panties and jeans it's so necessary
Why you frontin on me?
(Verse 3: Jay-Z)

Let's go to my hotel cause this don't go well

Oh no ma please respect ma

2004,92,Don't Tell Me,Avril Lavigne,"You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me that kiss
It was something like this and made me go oh, oh

You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?
The one who gives it all away, yeah

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah

Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm
Is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants
I'll have to kick your ass
And make you never forget

I'm gonna ask to you stop
Thought I liked you a lot but I'm really upset
(Really upset)
Get out of my head, get off of my bed
Yeah, that's what I said

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?
The one who throws it all away, yeah

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah

This guilt trip that you put me on
Won't mess me up, I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah

Better off that way
I'm better off alone anyway"
2004,93,You'll Think of Me,Keith Urban,"I woke up early this morning around 4a.m.
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's okay, there's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.

I went out driving, trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been.
So

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me.

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life.

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me.

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.

And you're gonna think of me
Oh, someday baby, someday"

And I can't take it yeah I can't shake it
No

I can't wait to see you
Want to see if you still got that look in your eyes
That one you had for me before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we got to spend our time
Being mad about the same things

Over and over again
About the same things
Over and over again

No

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything

But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playing in my head
Over and over again
Playing my head
Over and over again

2004,97,Redneck Woman,Gretchen Wilson,"Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet champagne, I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern, or in a honky tonk, or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid, and Strait
Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip

'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So, here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah

Victoria's Secret, well their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price
And still look sexy, just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me
Well, you might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door

Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long

2004,98,Just Lose It,Eminem,"Okay!

Guess who's back (back, back)
Back again ( 'gain, 'gain)
Shady's back (back, back)
Tell a friend (friend, friend)

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright stop - pajama time 

Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean wrap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation

Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
Having touched on everything but little boys

An' that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes

Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like tee pee for my bunghole and it's cool if you let one go

Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it
Give a little poot poot, it's okay (*fart*)
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
Get your chance, yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Just lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Go crazy (aah aah aah aah aah)
Oh baby (aah aah) Oh baby(aah aah) 

It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday 
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Every day's just a holiday

Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body

'Scuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...there

What's your name girl, what's your sign
Dr. Dre: Man, you must be up out your mind
Eminem: Dre, aah aah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Just lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Go crazy (aah aah aah aah aah)
Oh baby (aah aah) Oh baby(aah aah) 

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming (aah aah aah aah aah)

Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
Boy we got you on tape
Yelling at an old lady, 
""Touch my body.""

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real intense no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 

A step back to reality 
Look it's B. Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle
I'm a grown man 
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba 
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Tubba Teletubbie

Fellas (What?) fellas (What?) 
Grab your left nut, make the right one jealous (What?) 
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls 
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls

Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romance or 
Butt squeezin', it's the season 
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasing 

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

2004,99,Letters from Home,John Michael Montgomery,"My Dearest Son, it's almost June
I hope this letter Catches up with you and finds you well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol' in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said to much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared in our boots
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's womething funny
'Bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best y'all
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night Long,
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring
Man on the Television said
Something So I couldn't sleep
But iIll be all right, I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh 'cause she calls me honey
But they take it hard, 'cause I don't read the good parts
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me Drivin' on, waitn' on
Letters from home

Dear son, I know I ain't written
And sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me I might not have said it, so I'll say it now
Son, You make me proud

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs 'cause ain't nothin'
Funny when a soldier cries, and I just wipe my eyes
I fold it up and put in my shirt get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on,
Letters from home"
2004,100,I Go Back,Kenny Chesney,"'Jack and Diane' painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-ton short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

Well, I used to rock all night long
To 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back
(I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back
I go back"
2005,1,We Belong Together,Mariah Carey,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, oh
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should've held on tight, I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sittin' here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything, I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling, now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here 'cause, baby
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio, singing to me
""If you think you're lonely now.""
Wait a minute, this is too deep 
I gotta change the station 
So I turn the dial, trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back, baby, please 
'Cause we belong together

2005,7,Boulevard of Broken Dreams,Green Day,"I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk-a

My shadow's only one who walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk-a

My shadow's only one who walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone and I walk-a

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk-a

My shadow's only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone"

It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone

I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind

As long as she ain't stoppin', homie I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle it's on
And we gon' sip till every bubble in the bottle is gone

2005,10,Behind These Hazel Eyes,Kelly Clarkson,"Seems like just yesterday, you were a part of me
I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again

Just thought you were the one

I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give

Boy I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake it off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was

Hold up my phone's breakin' up
Imma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind

'Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't ya know

I gotta shake it off

How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss

Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke
And she's takin' a drag

Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head but she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go

And I just can't look
It's killing me
And taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay

This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

(Verse I - Game)
Fresh like, unhh; Impala, unnh
Chrome hyrdolics, 808 drums
You don't want, none

You know I'm rockin' with the best tre pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest

Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

(Verse III - Game)

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

Now it's hard for me
When my heart still on the mend
Open up to me
Like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me

And it's harmony
Girl what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything
Just to get you back again
Why can't we just try

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want another lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list?

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

What if I was good to you?
What if you were good to me?
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me?

And what if it was paradise?
And what if we were symphonies?
What if I gave all my life
To find some way to stand beside you?

Well, I don't wanna be lonely no more

2005,24,Hate It or Love It,The Game ,"50 Cent:
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

The Game:
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

50 Cent
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

The Game:
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma

50 Cent
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

2005,27,Breakaway,Kelly Clarkson,"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But, when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Hey switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn around, now switch

Hey, vibe to vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived naked
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
Hey, something sexy 'bout her
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now switch

Hey switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn around, now switch
Turn it over and hit it

Uh uh uh
I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like, ""Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody""
But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on
Switch

Hey switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn around, now switch
Turn it over and hit it

Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh
What you too cute to dance, or you scared

It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right hear waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo

Hey, hey

That's what I'm talking 'bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking 'bout, do that thing mama

Well it's early in the morning
And my heart is feelin' lonely
Just thinkin' about you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin turnin' in my bed
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' about your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feeling hopeless in my heart
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin')
What am I doin' wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (it's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart

Now I know you're not my lady
But I'm tryin' to make this right
I don't know what to do
I'm going out of my mind
So baby if you let me
Kick it with you then we'll maybe
We could ride together
We could do this all night
Now I don't care if you've got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' about your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feelin' hopeless at home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love

Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin' surene
Wear my candy you're my cream
Got your boy feeling supreme
Hold up wait a minute
Baby you so damn independent
Lovin' everything you're representing
Got alot of money and I love to spend it
And that's what's up
And I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cause momma know how I do
We gone rendezvous
Mi corazon belongs to you

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin')
What am I doin' wrong (what am I doin' wrong)

Who been doin' it my way, gettin' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life I hid love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down

'Cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

This girl was mean, she really turned me out

2005,35,Listen to Your Heart,DHT ,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark

Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why,
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why,
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices
That want to be heard
So much to mention
But you can't find the words
The scent of magic,
The beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why,
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

Listen to your heart
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why,
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye"

I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed 'cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause you channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassion's in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
You should have never come around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand

Go fix yourself!

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own life

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own life

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much

They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're damned as free

You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss because I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land

Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

2005,38,Let Me Go,3 Doors Down,"One more kiss could be the best thing
Or one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve

In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

And you love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go, let me go

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on lovin' you
How can this love be a good thing
And I know what I'm going through

In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

And you love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go, just let me go, let me go

And no matter how hard I try
I can't escape these things inside
I know, I know
But all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows, who knows

You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go, just let me go

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name

Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side

Can I get another amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

(Hey!)

(Three four)

The representative from California has the floor...

""Zieg Heil"" to the president gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel Towers
Who criticize your government

Bang bang, goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me

Just 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah!

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

2005,43,Photograph,Nickelback,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
It's time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me"

Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord
That's always been there
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride

Backtracking over these few years
Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

And I just let you walk right outta my life

And I would be out chasing you

Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see 
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

2005,45,Collide,Howie Day,"The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find, you and I collide

I'm quiet, you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find, you and I collide

Don't stop here
I've lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find, you and I collide

You finally find 
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide"

Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass, seven years has gone so fast

Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

While I'm beatin' and tearin down your walls (oh yeah)

This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eyeing you all day in the mall miss lady
You looking good, I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could
But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on, on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious
You delirious, or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like Almond Joys and Kisses
And you ah certified head doctor
Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Bend you over and I""ll follow you straight to the room
Where it goes down lovely in the Leagon of Doom

(Verse Two)
Shit, you know the deal before a nigga even stepped
Damn that ass hot, seems like it's gone melt
You know I give it to you till you run out of breathe
Then bust a nut all over yourself


The first time I called, you were juggling on my balls
In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
From the back (back) then to the side (side) to the front
Turn around, you down to ride
I smack them thighs, anyway that you want me
So gone see about a pimp and that monkey
And that's fo' sho'

(Verse Three)
What's the buiseness baby, can I get in them drawes
I like the way your hands rub against my balls
Cause you the one, a nigga met at south dekalb mall
With your pretty brown skin, thick thighs and all
135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, You a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'ma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill
And I feel, you love to fuck up on a hill
Suck dick from behind, and take nut in your grill
So bitch chill, and shut your mouth just for a second
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy"

That are still in the air, if you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands and lotion three quarters of his body
Please say put yo hands down, if yo spinnin rims
Spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin',
If you are dancin on the dancefloor and you look to
Yo left and yo right and you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what you guessed it you are not
Pimpin', if your Vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
Put your hands down, now look down, I need everybody to pull up your pants leg
One time ok, you see the nigga wit the white socks not pimpin'!
Sorry unless you tryna do the Beat It entorauge,
If your shoes have a buckle on, your not pimpin'"

But still you said the love was gone and that I had to leave

Now you
Talking about a family
Now you

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me

I remember when I was sitting home alone
Waiting for you
To 3 o'clock in the morn'

And when you came home you'd always had some sorry excuse
And explaining to me like I was some kind of a fool
I sacrifice the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through

Now you
Wanna be a part of me
Now you
Have so much to say to me
Now you
Wanna make time for me

Night after night knowing something's going on
What's that number for b go-a-go-a-gone

Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what your suppose to do
No need to punch me boo 'cause I won't play you cause

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me

What goes around comes around (yeah)
What goes up most come down

2005,57,Speed of Sound,Coldplay,"How long before I get in
Before it starts, before I begin
How long before you decide
Or before I know what it feels like
Where to, where do I go
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand
I'll start before I can stop
Or before I see things the right way up

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Or Japan and China all lit up
A sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I could've seen
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand"

Than a prison guard's son
I don't need to be anything other
Than a specialist's son

I don't have to be anyone other
Than the birth of two souls in one
Part of where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm coming from

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind

I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me

I'm surrounded by liars
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by imposters
Everywhere I turn

I'm surrounded by identity crisis
Everywhere I turn
Am I the only one who noticed?
I can't be the only one who's learned

I don't want to be anything other than me

Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave

The crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms

Wondering what I've got to do

I don't want to be"
2005,59,Mockingbird,Eminem,"Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)"

Gu√°rdate la alegr√≠a pa' ti

No pido que todos los d√≠as sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perd√≥n
Si lloras con los ojos secos y hablando de ella
Ay, amor, me duele tanto

Me duele tanto

Que te fueras sin decir a donde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura, perderte

Yo se que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor

No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy se que tuyo es mi coraz√≥n

Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adi√≥s

No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas

Ay, amor, me duele tanto
Me duele tanto
Que no creas m√°s en mis promesas

Ay, amor, es una tortura, perderte

Yo se que no he sido un santo

Oye, negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
D√©jame el s√°bado a mi que es mejor
Oye, mi negra, no me castigues m√°s
Porque all√° afuera sin ti no tengo paz
Yo solo soy un hombre muy arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido

Yo se que no he sido un santo
Y es que no estoy hecho de cart√≥n

No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy se que tuyo es mi coraz√≥n

Ay, ay, ay ay ay
Ay, todo lo que he hecho por ti
Fue una tortura perderte
Me duele tanto que sea asi
Sigue llorando perd√≥n
Yo, yo no voy...

But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken

Headlines and shows other rappers its bedtime (bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrerra to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit 'cause I get better wit time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine

I got a packed house yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

Mic check 1-2 1-2, you wanna beef wit the king what is you gon do
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew
Or you and ya friend and play a little two on two
If you knew half of what I knew then you'll be hittin the deck
Got a tool and a vest I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucka nigga to flex
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp my nutz too large and we way too fresh
Work well wit Nines AK's and Techs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef you can bring ya best and we'll be standin...

In ya front yard yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye all my hot girls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

2005,68,Best of You,Foo Fighters,"I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and onto someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
Your trust, you must
Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh...

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You'd die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
Your trust, you must
Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
Your trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

2005,70,Goin' Crazy,Natalie,"Ever since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same oh baby, no
When I looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go
I just broke down (down)

Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice
'Cause the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right
Its nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything

That's right baby I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby

Break it down now I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you it's been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me
And you love me I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you I'll put it down be the woman for you

I'm falling so deep for you crazy over for you
I'm calling, calling out to you what am I going to do?
It's true, no fronting
It's you and no other I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down (down)

I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything

That's right baby I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby

2005,71,Inside Your Heaven,Carrie Underwood,"I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around

I guess it's right
It's so amazing
Everytime I see you, I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone

Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
(I wanna be inside your heaven)
(Take me to that place you cry from)
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven"
2005,72,Because of You,Kelly Clarkson,"Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you"
2005,73,Truth Is,Fantasia,"Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face from a chapter in my past
Talked for awhile, asked him how he's been
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself


(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is it hurts
But I know that the fault's mine
'Cause I let him go
Tried to get over it, but it's messing with my mind (because I know)

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) But when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you

I just gotta be honest, I guess
I-I guess I'm still in love, in love, in love"

2005,80,These Words,Natasha Bedingfield,"These words are my own
 
Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you
 
I tried to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily
 
(Whoa) Tryin' to find the magic
(Whoa) Tryin' to write a classic
(Whoa) Don't cha know, don't cha know, don't cha know?
(Whoa) Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see ya later
 
These words are my own, from my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way to better say
I love you, I love you
 
Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keates
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm havin' trouble sayin' what I mean
With dead poets and a drum machine
 
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killer hook
Now you're gonna raise the bar right up
Nothin' I write is ever good enough
 
These words are my own, from my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way to better say
I love you, I love you
 
These words are my own, from my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way to better say

I'm gettin' off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes

Clever rhymes, see ya later

2005,81,Don't Lie,The Black Eyed Peas,"Will.i.am
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to you
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

Fergie
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie
'Cause you know-know-know-know, yeah you know-know-know-know you gotta try
What you're gonna do when it all comes out?
When I really see you and what you're all about?
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know, you know you gotta try

(Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop, stop lying)

Apl.de.ap
She said I'm leaving
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryna maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

Fergie and apl.de.ap
Oh oh, and I lie, and I lie, and I lie, and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
'Cause I lie, and I lie, and a little lie-lie
And now your emotions are drained

Fergie
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie (ooh, don't-don't you lie)
'Cause you know-know-know-know, yeah you know-know-know-know you gotta try (got to try, got to try)
What you're gonna do when it all comes out? (what you're gonna do baby?)
When I really see you and what you're all about?
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know, you know you gotta try

Taboo
Yo, I'm lyin' to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I'm lyin' to my girl, I do it

Fergie and Taboo
Oh oh, and I lie, and I lie, and I lie (and then I lie)
Till there's no turning back (I don't know why I lie and I lie)
And I lie, and I lie till I don't know who I am
And then I tell myself

Fergie
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie (don't you lie!)
'Cause you know-know-know-know, yeah you know-know-know-know you gotta try (you know, you know you gotta)
What you're gonna do when it all comes out?
When I really see you and what you're all about?
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie

No no no no, baby, no no no no

2005,82,Get Right,Jennifer Lopez,"You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt, you play it real cool homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me
Trippin', a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right

In my heart, in my heart
In my heart, in my heart

Your lips, talking about I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants
My hips moving oh so slow
Bar tab looking like a car note
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right

So much we got to say
But so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough
Don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand
I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right

2005,83,Daughters,John Mayer,"I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too"
2005,84,As Good as I Once Was,Toby Keith,"She said I seen you in here before
I said I been here a time or two
She said Hello my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feelin' kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face... I said girls...

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
If you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots, got in a tight spot
Hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big fat biker man
I heard David yell across the room
Hey buddy, how 'bout a helpin' hand... I said Dave...

I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
If you want to fight tonight
Guess them boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says you can't do this boy
But my pride says oh yes you can...

I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feelin' bullet proof
So don't double-dog dare me now
'Cause I might have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was"

2005,87,Ordinary People,John Legend,"Ho, ho
Ho, oh

Girl, I`m in love with you
This ain`t the honeymoon
We're past the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day

I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, ho
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, ho
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion, y'all
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way, huh

I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy, I still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, ho, oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh, oh, ha
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Maybe you'll never find
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow, we'll never know
Baby, you and I

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah, hey
Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey, hey

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go

2005,89,Just the Girl,The Click Five,"She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doing
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

She can't keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on 100 proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me, the more I adore her
What can I do?
I'd do anything for her

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

The way she sees it's me
On her caller I.D.
She won't pick up the phone
She'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
'Cause every word she's ever said
Is still ringing in my head
Still ringing in my head

She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doing
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else

That you belong with me

But deep inside in the corner of my mind
I'm attached to you

I'm weak, it's true
'Cause I'm afraid to know the answer
Do you want me too?
Cause my heart keeps falling faster

I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing that's true
So I will not hide
It's time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited
This is true

You don't know what you do
Everytime you walk into the room
I'm afraid to move

(Mike Jones)
Mike Jones!
Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 80 4's come rollin' up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my bar now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
2 8 1, 3 3 0, eight zero zero fo'
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah - because

(Mike Jones)
I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin' pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
2 slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller
She would want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryin' to call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' ho ass like you dogged me
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nuttin changed but my change, I'ma stay the same
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nuttin changed but my change, I'ma stay the same

(Mike Jones)
Befo' my paper came, befo' I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin' on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name start blowin' up quick, now they jumpin' on my dick
'Cause they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin' up quick, now they jumpin' on my dick
Because they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick"

Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for (Chester)
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

Get em Jay

(Jay-Z)
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin' me rap is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him with
Cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS

Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for (Chester)
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

Now what the hell are you waitin' for (Chester)

(Jay-Z)
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea, yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin' the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereeens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing (Mike))
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

(Chester)
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the under toe, just caught in the undertow) (Mike)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the under toe, just caught in the undertow) (Mike)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

Become so numb

(Mike, Jay-Z)
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more, more, more)

I've become so numb

One last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar"

Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
'Cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
It's the power of the p-u-s-s-y
Got a lotta niggas wonderin it ain't just i
Gotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life

Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
It puts over me

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down, upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your
Strength

Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the Earth
The Sun was just yellow energy

There is a living promise land
And even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind, and cover me
Bringing back, more than a memory

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down, upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your strength...

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over, the sides...
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

2005,98,Mississippi Girl,Faith Hill,"Yeah

Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Whoo!

Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Whoo!

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame

Respected highly, HIIII MR. O'REILLY
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of my Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded rapping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (All right)
Rappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm coming for they number one spot! (All right man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)
I'm coming for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it going it won't stop! (What you doing man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot!

Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell them holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later until these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin' so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
'Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (All right)
Rappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm coming for they number one spot! (All right man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)
I'm coming for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it going it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot!

Causing lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground running like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls
Ludacris sit down and take over the whole world!

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm coming for that number one spot! (All right)
Rappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm coming' for they number one spot! (All right man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)
I'm coming for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it going it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm coming for that number one spot!"

Did some daydreaming
Now I'm fiending like I'm on something
Girl don't hold it from me
Cause right now I'll be don strong on ya
I ain't the type to ruin your life
By running game and throwing your dreams

Sit you on some leather seats while blowing green
And switching lanes
Girl stop playing games let me beat it out the frame

(Chorus - repeat 4X)
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there

(Bun B from UGK) - Verse 2
She five foot seven a hundred and thirty nine pounds
Thirty six twenty four thirty eight pretty fine brown
Bad lil broad I ain't seen her in a minute
Since the All-Star game and I'm still tryin' to hit it
Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
I got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating
We some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating

(Chorus - repeat 4X)
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there

(Lil Webbie) - Verse 3
Now I can tell from your size that that pussy is fire
So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie
I might share a lil meal just don't tell nobody
Look you know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl you want it just as bad as I do
But check this out
You gon be wishing that you been gave me your money
By the time I finish rumbling with you
While rhymes get loose let's take this shit to the room
And you just keep yourself excited till we get to the room
'Cause I've been rocked up since I met you
I'm ready to give you the blues
Don't stunt now take off your shoes
Don't act confused you know what time it is

(Chorus - repeat 4X)
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there"
2006,1,Bad Day,Daniel Powter,"Where is the moment when we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

(A holiday)
You had a bad day
(A holiday)
You had a bad day
(A holiday)
You had a bad day"

Timbaland: Nope
Nelly: Didn't think so

Timbaland: How you doin' young lady?
That feelin' that you givin' really drives me crazy
You don't have to play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light

You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
Will you still respect me if you get it?

All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want

Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?

You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
Are you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kind of cute

Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'mma lay mine's down

I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'mma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health

I want you on my team
So does everybody else

Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know

If you with it girl, I know a place we can go

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

(Bring that on?) You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things

I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

2006,4,You're Beautiful,James Blunt,"My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

No fighting, no fighting

She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama, si, bonita, si, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Shakira
Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight 
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Wyclef Jean
Hey girl, I can see your body moving 
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, si, bonita, si, mi casa, su casa

Back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates for humpty humpty
I need a whole club dizzy

Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction 
No more do we snatch ropes 
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin

Only you can let it in

Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Sometimes my tries 
Are outside the lines
We've been conditioned 
To not make mistakes

2006,7,Crazy,Gnarls Barkley,"I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mmm

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice, mmm

Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them

Mmm, ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen

Ride with a new chick, she like ""hold up""
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma

Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' to bone ain't tryin' to have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas try to jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em
Will have a nigga locked up in the maximum

Security cell, I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twin's steady twistin' like ""Hit this dough""
Police pull up right behind and is in his throat

Windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD changes, niggas like, ""Who is that producin'?""
This the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

I been drinkin' and smokin'
Holdin' shit cause a brother can't focus
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope
This big ol' Excursion swervin' all up in the curve

A nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey
And the gin again, it's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck

I got a blunt up my right hand
40 oz. in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs

Yo, I gotta get back to backstreets
Wonderin' about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock-Glock, shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key

With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like ""fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
But well if you want, nigga, you poppin' dark
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air

Now do what you think it so, I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slower
And they upset for sho cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro

So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, well keep tryin'
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'

Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood

I'ma laugh at you, and then I'm a have to cruise
Yeah, my number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws, tellin' them ""We hate you""

I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home

2006,11,Be Without You,Mary J. Blige,"I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time

People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)

It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real shit (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)

Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)

I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

See this is real talk
I'm always stay (no matter what)
Good or bad (thick and thin)
Right or wrong (all day, every day)

Now if you're down on love or don't believe
This ain't for you (no, this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true (come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (hands up)

Fellas tell your lady she's the one (fellas tell your lady she's the one, oh)
Put your hands up (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love
Look him right in his eyes and tell him
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you

I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewin' on aluminum foil
Smilin', showin' off my diamonds sippin on some potin oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real

My motivation is from thirty pointers V VS the furniture
My mouthpiece simply symbolize success
I got da wrist wear and neck wear that's captivatin'
But it's my smile that's got these on-lookers spectatin'

My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carats than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin', givin' everybody chills
Call me George Foreman, 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grillz

Tippin' on some fours, you can see my mouth jewelry

2006,13,Over My Head (Cable Car),The Fray,"I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth

But that's how it's got to be
It's comin' down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along

But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the arguments in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on, oh

And suddenly, I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless

Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground in the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind"

Do do do do do do do-do
Oh yeah

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone

And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah

(Enough is enough)
No more walkin' 'round with my head down
I'm so over being blue 
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio? Oh

(Leave me alone) Leave me alone 
(Stupid love songs) Oh
Hey, don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)

Said I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)

And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
Why can't I turn off the radio?"

Yung Joc
Niggas in my face
Damn near er' day
Askin a million questions like

Tell 'em College Park
Where they chop cars
Eat 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, jays on my feet
I'm on that Patron so get like me
'69 cutlass wit the bucket seat
Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto'
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin' dough
If a girl choose let her do her thang
Just like her mama and I ain't sayin' the name brain
Er'body love me I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why

Don't ask me just do what cha do (OK)

(Chorus - repeat 2X)
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Verse numba 2, do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck pockets full of Ben Franks
When I'm in the mall hoes just pause
I pop a few tags give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work make the block bump
Boys in the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boi magic seven days a week
Numba one record long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me betta yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew we ceritifed stars
Ready in the front bout 35 cars
Bitches in the back
Black beamer coups
Girls like girls time to recruit
If ya got a problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

Time to set it off, let these niggas know
Have ya every seen a chevy wit the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet
Feds on my trail, but they thank I don't know
I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask 'em how I know, it's me, surprise!
Put it in the air, rep where ya stay
Take a step back blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats

Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, whatcha gonna?""

Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace

She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

She's a lover, baby, and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

California, rest in peace

Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a-gunnin' for the quota

Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last

Gone too fast

2006,26,What Hurts the Most,Rascal Flatts,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder: getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you

2006,27,How to Save a Life,The Fray,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"
2006,28,Unfaithful,Rihanna,"Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door

I don't wanna be a murderer

Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"
2006,30,Lips of an Angel,Hinder,"Honey, why you calling me so late?
It's kind of hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying? Is everything okay?
I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes, I dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me?
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think he has a clue

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye

Honey, why you calling me so late?"
2006,31,Everytime We Touch,Cascada,"I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive

'Cause every time we touch I get this feeling
And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch I feel this static
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so, I can't let you go
Want you in my life

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

'Cause every time we touch I get this feeling
And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch I feel this static
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so, I can't let you go
Want you in my life

'Cause every time we touch I get this feeling
And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last

Something moved me deep inside

Weighed down with words too
Over-dramatic
Tonight it's ""it can't get much worse""
Versus ""no one should ever feel like""

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by

Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love if they knew
How misery loved me

You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake and

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love

2006,38,Photograph,Nickelback,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
It's time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me"
2006,39,Because of You,Kelly Clarkson,"Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you

2006,43,Where'd You Go,Fort Minor ,"Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

She said, ""Some days I feel like shit""
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long

And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while

Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Do do do do do
Yeah

Yo,
Tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick
That a young'n
Never seen before

I said Yo,
Tell her girls I want to meet her (meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I got to give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it
There she is I got to stop her

Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time
She's out the door
I got to go for mine

I think I'll say

Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby

Now shorty grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the flow is ours
You say you don't really dance

Don't worry about it
We'll just one, two, step
One, two, step

Now if the music is moving too fast
Grab my hand a little tighter
Don't be afraid to move a little closer

Girl, there is something about you that makes me want to say

Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby

Breakdown
I want to be where you are,
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing.

Baby it's so romantic.

Baby I can be in your heart.

So many things I want to tell you,
I think that I should start by saying ""Yo.""

I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

I got to give her game proper,
Ppit it so she get it,
There she is - I got to stop her.

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby.

spoken:
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (like this),
Just clap your hands like this (whooo like this).

And if your shorty is in the house tonight,
Just grab her by the hand homie,
Make her understand y'all was made to dance like this (like this).

Y'all was made to bounce like this (whoa like this).

Just let her know she was made for you,
And you want to do everything she want to man.

Are you gonna fight for me, die for me
Live and breathe for me
Do you care for me
'Cause if you don't then just leave

Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Hurry I'm fallin'

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me"
2006,50,Don't Forget About Us,Mariah Carey,"Don't forget about us
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
Don't forget about us
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go

Just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
We both paid the price

Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I want to reach out to you
But I turn around and I let it ride

Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart
And I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to

What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny

So baby we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do it like me
She'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever

I have loved you all along
And I miss you

Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance

All of hell to hold your hand

Pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't want to waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes

Yeah

'Cause I want you
And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger
Like a burning
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken
And I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

I've been dying inside
Little by little
No where to go
But going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

And I want you
And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger
Like a burning
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken
And I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

Falling faster
Barely breathing
Give me something
To believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head

Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole
Once again

'Cause I want you
And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
A hunger
Like a burning
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken
And I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have all that's left, yeah yeah yeah
What's left of me?

I've been dying inside you see
I'm going out my
Out my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?

Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?

(Chorus: Ciara)
They say he do a little of this
He do a little of that
He's always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He got a lot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say he think he's slick
He got a lot of chips
He's so messed up, I heard
He's been locked up Find Somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what

And they say I'm a slut, I'm a hoe, I'm a freak
I got a different girl every day of the week
You too smart to
You'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard
That they say about me
They say I done this
They said I done that
But all of it's fiction none of it's facts
But you don't be hearing that about your love
You let it go in one ear and out the other
The he say, she say, they say, I heard
The beef ain't, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes there
Nothing but liars hating I bet
They wouldn't mind trading places
With you by my side in my Mercedes

Haters throw salt like rice at a wedding
So what, that's your cousin
That don't mean nothing
Her like missing in a tight of affection
You get, you just blind to the facts
See the lies, just obvious drives for attention
You to the fine just supply your suspicious
But listen, say you love me
Gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess
Break up never, they just jealous
Drama for your mama, mean mug for your brother
I'm the author of the book nigga judge by the cover, yes
I-I been to jail, yes
I-I'm grinding for real and
I'm positive, they talking negative pimp
They hate to see you doing better then them, so

Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

I felt a little fear, upon my back
I said, ""Don't look back, just keep on walking.""
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
When the big black horse said, ""Look this way.""
He said, ""Hey lady, will you marry me?""
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

But I said, ""No, no. No, no-no-no.
""No, no. You're not the one for me.
""No, no. No, no-no-no.
""No, no. You're not the one for me.""

(Ooh, woo-hoo)

No, no, no, no.

And my heart had a problem, in the early hours,
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that,
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Now It won't come back, 'cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see

2006,61,My Love,Justin Timberlake ,"Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say ""I do""

Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say ""I do""

Yeah, because

Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand

[Rap by T.I.:]
Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly

Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy

I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(Love) My love
(Love) My love

Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin' that ass on the flow
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up

Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Nate Dogg
2 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat

3 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey

I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock

Get ya ass off the wall with your 2 left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We about to have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead, shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day, she be givin' it up

Nate Dogg
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Eminem
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow, and I'll finish

Yeah me and Nate D-O-double G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party

Nate Dogg
Have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead, shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

Eminem
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

'Nate Dogg
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Baby I'm a superstar and that come wit it
You got a good nigga on the side, u betta run wit it,
Even though I'm on tha road doin' shows,
I make time for me 'n' her, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her

Give her some space and the next day I might call
What should I do
Look, let me ask y'all
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed
But it happens some time
It's either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man

Weak 'n' stressed out
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next round

Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're

No time to waste, back to my place

2006,67,One Wish,Ray J,"Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time"

I've been dyin' to tell you anything you want to hear

Drop a heart, and break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet,
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Wishing to be the friction in your jeans

Ooh Oh.

The dynamic duo.

spoken:
Wow wow wow wow... it's what your body sayin'.

Chris Brown is in the building.

The young boy just turned 16
And I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock

Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock,
But all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him.

Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop, cause you speaking that slang that I talk.

That sassy tempo with that walk, maybe the reason that all this jeans (?) may never see me.

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the lac,
You can be in the bac saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)

Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thongs
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, call it perk body zone
Now she pussy poppin', it's goin' down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her ""get another round""
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground
Fresh force ones, Sean John button down
And then I'm like ""oh boy, a clique fulla stars""
Big four fifth, big dick, and big cars
At the end of the day, when it's all said and done
I need four freaks 'cause I need more than one

2006,71,Who Says You Can't Go Home,Bon Jovi ,"I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place 
I was looking for something I couldn't replace 
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known

And like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back 
The seeds I've sown, saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own 
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million miles of memories on that road 
And every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known,
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own 
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road, feels like I've never left
That's how the story goes

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go 
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road 
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?"

Now I run the bass, hi hat and the snare
Used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me

Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true

Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate

The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down get back up again

You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over
It's over

How could I have burned paradise?
How could I? You were never mine

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me
Just get your things
I've made up your mind"
2006,78,"Jesus, Take the Wheel",Carrie Underwood,"She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on""

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me"

2006,82,Hate Me,Blue October,"
If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me

Mother:
Hi, Justin, this is your mother.
It's 2:33 on Monday afternoon.
I was just calling to see how you were doing, you sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous, too.
I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too.
You know I love ya!
Take care, honey, I know you're under a lot of pressure.
See ya.
Bye, bye!

I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away""
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?""

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

For you
For you
For you

If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me

Saying that I love you

2006,87,Waiting on the World to Change,John Mayer,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door

And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change"

Another day, another dolla (dolla)-same block, same nigga, same part, same green

We let the Thugs do it for us--we don't cry tears (That's right)
Real niggaz don't budge
When Mail Man got his time he shot birds at the judge (Yeah)
I'm knee deep in the game
So when it's time to read up, I'm knee deep in the 'caine (Damn)

And this is er'day, it never gets old (Old)

Gotta drive real cool when them pi's be on you (pi's be on you)
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous (ball outrageous)
Them alphabet boards gotta us under survalence (Ay)

The same nigga that's a star when you put 'em on stages

Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself
(Let's Get It) No nuts, no glory (no glory)
My biography, you damn right, the true story (Yeah)
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try (try)
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ay)

(Bridge - Akon)
'Cause if you lookin' for me you you can find me
On the block disobeyin' the law

Pants saggin' with my gun in my draws

Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now"

2006,90,When I'm Gone,Eminem,"Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?""
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back"

(Juicy J)
They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Ridin' in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breakin' down the good green, rollin' the blunt
Ghetto pimp tight, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Ridin' through the hood, got me grippin' the grain
And I'm sippin' the same while I'm changin' the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm chokin' the green
Vision messed up cause I'm drinkin' the lean
Messin' with a D-Boy, ridin' them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part and be buyin' the bar

(DJ Paul)
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga, your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad, she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies, we live them lives
Keep them eyes tight, ridin' round what they like
Make a couple numb, a couple will die
So purple, purple, purple and swallow it down with
The yurple, yurple, yurple, it's goin' down

Puff-puff, pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high, nigga smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my g's
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rollin' Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own
Cause them niggaz there let me smoke for free

(Crunchy Black)
What's up, Mary (how you doin')
Mary Jane (stalkin' me)

Premro, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Ros√© Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost six fifty
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughin' and chokin' constantly
Taste like soup when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me, bro

(MJG)
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga runnin' back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at
Cuttin' up a cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the mornin, when I need this and breathe again a whole lotta weed, but uh
I'm needin' somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothin' less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, Eightball and MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton, girl, take it out ya mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

You're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her
You ain't see in me

Yelling and throwing things

Knowing that it makes you mad
I'm sorry that seeing you mad is so sexy

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place?
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around 
That makes me wanna tear you down?
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you

But you're so damn sexy
When you're mad

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better 
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place?
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around 
That makes me wanna tear you down?

What happened to the dreams of a girl president
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Break it down now)
The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take any more
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see
Disaster's all around
A world of despair
My only concern:
Will it fuck up my hair!

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Do ya thing, do ya thing, do ya thing)
(I like this, like this, like this)
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair I'll suck it girl, stupid girl!
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair I'll suck it girl, stupid girl! 

Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, stupid girl!  

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl"

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're damned as free

You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss because I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining them up like ass cracks
Lay these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack

Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care Bear reppin' in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahaa

Yo, we goin' ghost town, this Motown
With yo sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo sound, you kill the Inc.

Until you jet ahead
Yo, watch the way I navigate

2006,99,Do I Make You Proud,Taylor Hicks,"I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall

My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know

I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)
But do I make you proud?

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud?
But do I make you proud?

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud"
2006,100,For You I Will (Confidence),Teddy Geiger,"Wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have

Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel about you

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will

Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
'Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes like a water bed

Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I want to be exposed and not be afraid to fall

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you

If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a mood, yeah I would
Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah

That's what I'd do
That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have

And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now she's probably up singing
Some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive

I'm a thousand miles away, but girl
Tonight you look so pretty

Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen

Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me girl, someday
I'll pay the bills with this guitar

We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away

I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way

Delilah I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history

Like I do

I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Snoop Dog
Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, hoe sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say: ""I don't talk, Dogg, unless you told on me"", oh well

Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do
Baby, stick to me and I'mma stick on you
If you pick me then I'mma pick on you
D-o-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you

I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot 'fore the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and baby you're pussy for life

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Shorty I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
See you lookin' at me now what it's gon' be
Just another tease far as I can see

Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub

And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala use to move 'phetamines
Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Snoop Dog
Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (just smokin')
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (baby I see you), mmm

It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

Akon
Girl, and while you're looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary

'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Lil' mully don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl"
2007,9,Say It Right,Nelly Furtado,"In the day, in the night
Say it right, say it all
You either got it or you don't
You either stand or you fall

When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan

Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh, you could mean everything to me

I can't say (say) that I'm not (not)
At a loss (loss) and at fault (fault)
I can't say (say) that I don't (don't)
Love the light (light) and the dark

I can't say that I don't (don't)
Know that I am alive
And I love what I feel (feel)
I could show (show you) you tonight, you tonight

Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh, you could mean everything to me

From my hands, I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you
Another brick that I laid

From my body (from my body) I could show you (I could show you)
A place (a place) God knows (that only God knows)
You should know, this space is holy (oh)
Do you really wanna go? (two, three, four)"

All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines
Shopping for expensive thangs

I be on the movie screens
Magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days
When I had a Mustang and now I'm

Telling me these crazy things that I don't want to know (fuck y'all)
I've got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you really though

'Cause I remember yesterday when I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that be really cool
Damn It's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry

It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid

I want to dive into you
Forget what we're going through
I get behind, you make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in

I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

Could she be that lady

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Up front style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed down
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now

(I feel it) Go on and crack now
(Oh, I see it) Don't let back now
(I'm-a call her) Then I put the mack down

Get a little drink on, they goin' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it

Pedicure, manicure, kitty cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Pretty Cat Dolls
Try'na hold my woody back through my drawers

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're
I'm like, I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place

Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got a pal, every gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing! (Akon!)

The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit that shit I watch 'em get it on the floor

And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it any day
Compton to Hollywood as soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in that low-low, I do it the Cali way

44 songs, nigga gimme what you got

I'm into drivin' cars, push 'em off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down just so I can shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me what you need, you know I get 'em by the flock

I call my homie Black, meet me on the ave
I hit Wash Heights with the money in the bag
We into big spinners, see my pimpin' never dragged
Find me wit' different women that you niggas never had

For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between, you'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so clean, the way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot my nigga this is what I mean

Ask me what I paid and I say, ""Yeah, I paid a guap.""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop

They hop in the car, I tell them, ""All aboard!""
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em, man, they tell me that's they song

They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck and compliments the arm 
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare

Then niggas start to hate, tearrange their face
But little do they know I keep them things by waist-side
I reply: Nobody gotta die
Similar to Li'l Weezy 'cause I got that fire

Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand

I'm a real producer and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an

Now, I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV, ""Just let me clear the air...""
We missed you on the charts last week, damn, that's right, you wasn't there

If se-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit-it-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way

Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand

So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it

And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)

Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now, it's all just a shame

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone

I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt

Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
You'll see

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot
(Ba ba da da, ba ba da da.)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But mama I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (ba ba da da)

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

It's been awhile since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da)

I love it when she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da)

It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure, like.
Nah... na na naa na naa

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot
(Ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise

And it doesn't stop there
Man I swear
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song

But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word

And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like here.

2007,24,How to Save a Life,The Fray,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"
2007,25,Home,Daughtry,"I'm staring out into the night, trying to hide the pain
I'm goin' to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain

Well I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, well I'm going home

The miles are getting longer it seems, the closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true and I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try

So I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all and then some you don't want
Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all, yeah

Oh, I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
I said these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, I'm going home"
2007,26,My Love,Justin Timberlake ,"Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say ""I do""

Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love

Oh, girl
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say ""I do""

Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand

[Rap by T.I.:]
Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly

Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy

I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(Love) My love

2007,28,We Fly High,Jim Jones,"I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes unless my head is bent, you dig?

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Ya boy gettin' paper (Money), I buy big cars (Foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (Choose one)
Stay sky high (Twisted), Fly wit the stars (Twinkle, Twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (Ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missing (Flossin')
I'm sitting clean with the bottom kitted (do it)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistening (Ballin'!)
But I spent bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doing the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screaming ""fuck the cops""

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (One chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (Speeding)
100 g's worth of ice on the audermar? (Flossy)
And we in the street life until they call the law (Ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (What happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet (Got em)
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 a.m.: we was at the club (What happened?)
2 a.m.: 10 bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)
And about 3-something I was thinking about grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (Twisted)

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Nigga, could you buy that?
I keep 20 in the pocket (Light Change)
Talk a buck 80 If the bentley is the topic (That Grey Poupon)
But of course gotta fly ...? (Where?)
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (Get Your Money Up)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got an urge (Speeding)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous living in the fast lane (Ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'mma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (Let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

When you're dealin' with a motherfuckin' G
You know my name, Jones, One Eye, Capo Status

Ludacris
Now little Lisa is only 9 years old
She's tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all all alone and they never met her family
Mamas always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listenin'
Mama is on drugs gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with laughs--usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mamas knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.

Little Nicole is only 10 years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
There's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but some get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.

Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops x to get rid of all the pain
'Cause she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection hes usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrows satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's 'bout to run away and never come back.

2007,36,Rockstar,Nickelback,"I'm through with standing in line to clubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

(Mmm so what you need)

I'll need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

(So how ya gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there

Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
And we'll, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

(I'll have the quesadilla, on the house)

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

(So how ya gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses drivin' fifteen cars

We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's ""Who's Who""
They'll get you anything, with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial
Well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show

But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life

One night, yeah, and one more time;
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories

In hotel rooms

Get me out of my mind
Get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from
Getting you into the mood. Whoa

2007,38,What I've Done,Linkin Park,"In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

For what I've done, I'll start again and whatever pain may come
Today this ends, I'm forgiving what I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

Now I'm missing you and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Why did you have to go?
You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone

Girl you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand
And all my tears they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So baby I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away
(When) Everything stays the same
I just can't do it baby

What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what it is and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me?
You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby why can't we just start all over again
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So baby I will wait for you

Don't tell me I ran out of time

It's kind of hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying? Is everything okay?
I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes, I dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me?
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think he has a clue

Oh well, my girl's in the next room

2007,47,Waiting on the World to Change,John Mayer,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door

And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change"

Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' her eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick all alone (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit' her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to
Rollin' like I supposed to, shinin' like I supposed to
In the club, fuckin' wit' honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin' all on the floor wit' his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas tryna holla at her
Just soon as you go to the bathroom nigga I'mma holla at her
A dog on the prawl when I'm walkin' through the mall

And if I get that tonight better hit that twice

2007,50,If Everyone Cared,Nickelback,"From underneath the trees, we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight

Singing, amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing, amen, I, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

I'm singin' amen, I
Amen, I, I'm alive
Amen, I, amen, I
Amen, I, I'm alive

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

Singing, amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing, amen, I, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

When nobody died

And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride

Hopin' that you stay with me
You search around the world
But you will never find
Another Shorty Like Mine
Shorty Like Mine.

I tell my niggas that uh you got a girl but she ain't nothin' like mine
Cute face nice size like mine
Stay kitted hood with It like mine.
Mean walk talk Chris help me tell 'em what's up?

All this love inside of me
And all I want to do is give it to her.
I don't care what the fellas say 'about it
'Cause I got somethin' to say 'about it
What I'm about to say is straight up real talk no cut I don't play 'about it.
There ain't a price you can put on a girl who knows
Just what to say you when you need to hear it the most
And I'm a tell you somethin' else if I don't know nothin' else I know.

Only thing that keeps me up
When I'm feelin' down...
(Only thing that I need)
I don't know about you
But I gotta keep mines around...
(I gotta have a hoe)
'Cause I done looked I done searched
And it's hard to find
Another Shorty Like Mine.

Addicted to how we kick it
Everything you say to me...
(Oh yeah)
Never knew it could be so wicked
Hopin' that you stay with me
You search around the world...

But you will never find...
(Never find)
Another Shorty Like Mine
Shorty Like Mine.

I tell my niggas that uh you got a girl but she ain't nothin' like mine
Cute face nice size like mine
Stay kitted hood with It like mine
Mean walk talk the talk let me tell you some mo'.

I want to give her the world &amp; I ain't never tryin' to lose her
I'm addicted to my girl and the way she twirls in that little skirt
Just for me in the club, in the crib in the streets
She reps for L.B. Dub E.N.T.
She have nice size with them pretty brown bright eyes
I'm a win it with the right prize &amp; I'm gonna give it to her
To the rhythm of a high hat, she got a beautiful mind you can't buy that
And the sight from behind when she walk on by
Make a nigga wanna try that
She got the prettiest smile and she gangsta
Keep me from runnin' wild &amp; I thank her
And we can talk about anything she got good conversation
My homey little friend and plus she patient.

Only thing that keeps me up
When I'm feelin' down
I don't know about you
But I gotta keep mines around
'Cause I done looked I done searched
And it's hard to find
Another Shorty Like Mine
Baby yes I'm
Addicted to how we kick it
Everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked
Hopin' that you stay with me
You search around the world
But you never find
Another Shorty Like Mine, Shorty Like Mine.

2007,55,It Ends Tonight,The All-American Rejects,"Your subtleties they strangle me 
I can't explain myself at all 
And all the wants, and all the needs
All I don't want to need at all 

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening 
I give the final blow

When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

A falling star, at least I fall alone 
I can't explain what you can't explain 
You're finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving 
Maybe it's best you leave me alone 
A weight is lifted on this evening 
I give the final blow 

When darkness turns to light 
It ends tonight, it ends tonight 
Just a little insight won't make this right 
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight

Now I'm on my own side 
It's better than being on your side 
It's my fault when you're blind 
It's better that I see it through your eyes 

All these thoughts locked inside 
Now you're the first to know 

When darkness turns to light 
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

Just a little insight won't make this right 
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight
It ends when darkness turns to light 
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

Just a little insight won't make this right 
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight
Tonight, insight 
When darkness turns to light it ends tonight"

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard,
I tried hard... but I guess I
Gotta try harder.

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin' a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,
Goin' crazy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it,
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off till later.

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

It's like I'm takin' five steps forward, and ten steps back
Tryin' get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh,
I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and
It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and
Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain
I keep inflinctin on my family (family)
Hustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin'
And losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man
And I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin' not to panic

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

I see thangs won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it
Keeps pullin me back mayne
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no 9 to 5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean
Hustlers ballin in force I'm tryin' make that major league
So we never leave never, till the sun came up
Gotta get it nope no leavin' no rush
Today games they play gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause i...

2007,59,Welcome to the Black Parade,My Chemical Romance,"When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it, the anthem won't explain it

And while that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me, 'cause I cannot care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all (We'll carry on)
We wanna play this part

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world (We'll carry on)
Will never take my heart
Go and try (We'll carry)
You'll never break me
We want it all (We'll carry on)
We wanna play this part"

The hottest thing in the city baby you can't ignore it,
I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it,
First time I caught her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back,
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right,
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe,
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like,
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night,
Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable To fuck up your whole life,
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice,

Broke up wit my Ex he wit her for now but
Little do she know she just a rebound
Callin my phone she so outta pocket
I been there before o'girl you need to stop it
Trickin on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture
My pictures in his wallet
Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dog roam now he wanna come home
But I
Don't trust him
Though I still love him
No longer want him
Lookin' at his cousin
Kinda buzzin
Loose off the goose
Got him on a chase like cranberry juice
When he's wit you he's wishin it was me
You might be where he's at but I'm where
He wanna be (Baby Baby!)

Let It Go

And I'm hearin' what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you,
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new

I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
""Sorry"" like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late

I've been awake for a while now
You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile

Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go

2007,69,Who Knew,Pink,"You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed in everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

If someone said three years from now you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out, 'cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever and ever
Who knew

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
Before they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever and ever
Who knew

I'll keep you locked in my head until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened

If someone said three years from now you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and
That last kiss I'll cherish until we meet again

And time makes it harder
I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory
You visit me in my sleep

My darling I miss you

2007,70,Never Again,Kelly Clarkson,"I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell by the flames that burned your words?

I never read your letter 'cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer. Try to make it all okay

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
She may believe you, but I never will
Never again

If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh how cute. Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you, you'll die together but alone

You wrote me in a letter, you couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer, repent yourself away

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did

Now they ask how I talk, what you know about that?
Dominated '06, now I'm goin' right back
See me rain hell, I just showed you like that
Even Denzel say, ""Damn, I ain't know it like that""
Nigga yeah, still Bankhead, you can tell
Ain't nothin' changed but the name on the mail
I still kick in doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slangin the chair
I will slang 'caine, no such thing as a jail
Say you need a hundred squares? It just came off the scale

Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Now lemme hear you say
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option

Now do it like a ball player
Where you see me ball at
Stacks tall as ball players
From the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati, or the Riverdale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
Pullin' out that pistol nigga, who you think you fin' to scare?
Twenty rounds of missiles'll have you pissin' in your underwear
I tote about 40 cal so you better tone it down
Or I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it goin' down
A-Town, West Side, Club Krucial
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro, and Mack be
Jackers lie, say they caught me slippin', how could that be?
I'm something like a stalker, I be e'rywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumpin' with them hundred dollar slabs
If I want it nigga, I could get a hundred on the tab
Sell 'em all, double down, nigga do the math
Think I won't pull up in something with 200 on the dash?

Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Now lemme hear you say
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option

Now I do it like I wanna do it and do that shit in front of you
Real nigga vision pimpin', I ain't seein' none of you
I do it for my nigga Phil's daughter and his mama too
I do it for my oldest sons and their grandmama too
Do it for my daughters and my youngest son's mama who
Go buy what she want because she know it ain't a problem to
You do something to them and to you I'll bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partners, go make sure them niggas stuntin' too
We do it with them choppers, ain't no problem, where you runnin' to?
I do it for the block, that why ain't nobody stoppin' me
I do it for my pop and my cousins too, they watchin' me
I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top where I oughta be
Who do it did good and do it did fresh
No matter what I do you know I do it to death

Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Do it, do it, do it whatchu waiting for
Now lemme hear you say
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin', and lil shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option"
2007,76,No One,Alicia Keys,"I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you

There ain't no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you"
2007,77,The Great Escape,Boys Like Girls,"Paper bags and plastic hearts
All our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye
But we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
And we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

All of the wasted time
The hours that were left behind
The answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing tonight

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
But we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight"

2007,79,Walk Away (Remember Me),Paula DeAnda ,"I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me

You gonna remember me boo
I'm gonna remember you too
I can't forget all the crazy shhh... we used to do
You was doing too much
I wasn't doing enough
That's what your friends are saying
You got a man anyway
I can't explain it neither
I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell ya its hard to walk away when I see ya
When I see ya I remember the day
You put your shoes on and moved on
Before I could say

I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet
When you've had a long day
Scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids
Does she know that you like too
Play PS2 till 6 in the morning
Like I do

I can't explain this feeling
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on
It gets so hard to walk away
(I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me)
Walk Away, Walk Away
(I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me)

I can't forget how we used to be
Our life from day to day
Hoping maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
Though I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question
Does he kiss me on the forehead
Before we play
Show up on my doorstep
(With a bouquet)
Does he call me in the middle of the day
Just to say hey baby I love you
Like you used to

I can't explain this feeling
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on
It gets so hard to walk away
(I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me)
Walk Away, Walk Away
(I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me)

I'm Gonna Remember You
Your Gonna Remember Me
The things we did
The way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me
My friend, my love, my family
How did we loose a love that seemed meant to be
Sometimes I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing
Sometimes I miss him and wish that it was you I'm missing
Sometimes I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging
And I realize how much I'm bugging
I miss you

Walk Away, Walk Away

(I'm Gonna Remember You
Your Gonna Remember Me)

So hard to express this feeling
Cause nobody compares to you
And you know she'll never love you like I do

I can't explain this feeling
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on
It gets so hard to walk away

(I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me)

Walk Away, Walk Away

Remember You

(I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me)

(I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me)"

They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape.

Then you find out why all the boys stare.

See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go...

Watchin' her do her thing on all fours

From side to side, let the ride break it down-down-down

Damn...
I mean I just keep thinkin' about you.
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on.
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know.
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it.

Listen...

Bow Wow:
I'm sittin' lookin' out the window like damn
Tryin' to fix the situation that's at hand
You still runnin' through my mind when I'm knowin' that you shouldn't be
Me I'm on your mind? &amp; I'm knowin' that it couldn't be
'Cause you ain't called I ain't even appalled
I still got alot of pain I ain't dealt with at all
I've been runnin' around with other chicks
I'm single and they lovin' it
I'm likin' it but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it I'm tryin' to let you know
I can't get a grip of it is what I'm tryin' to let you know
You got a hold of some kind of control of me
I don't know what it is but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm workin' at it and it ain't gettin' no better
Just tryin' to be like ""Yeah, Forget It, Whatever""
Instead of starin' out this glass lookin' at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together 'cause...

T-Pain:
When I'm with somebody all I think about is you, yeah
When I'm alone that's all I wanna do, yeah
I miss the smilin' faces in my sidekick
Out of town visits all the time we spend together makes it hard to get you Outta My System.
And you know what you do to me, do to me
You don't even understand damn
And you know what you do to me do to me
It's so hard to get you Outta My System.

Bow Wow:
I'm too attached my heart won't let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that
And when I see you in the streets that's the worst for me
I used to love the little things you did that's what works for me
It's too major I see you on my pager
Knowin' what your doin' where you at or ""Can I see you later?""
The fellas tellin' me ""Just let her go Bow.""
Believe me I'm tryin' man I just don't know how
I be in all the top spots even with the hot shots knowin' they just want me 'cause I'm in the top spot
That's not poppin' and my brain ain't stoppin' thinkin' who she with or where she goin' is she club hoppin'?
I never had this kind of problem in my life
This is my first time dealin' with this kind of fight
It's every night and every flight and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right 'cause...

T-Pain:
When I'm with somebody all I think about is you, yeah
When I'm alone that's all I wanna do, yeah

Oh.
And you know what you do to me, do to me
You don't even understand damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
It's so hard to get you Outta My System.

Bow Wow:
Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You've been runnin' through my mind all day.
Can you feel me?
I've been tryin' to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time that's what kills me.

(Bow Wow: Spoken)
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had a whole life planned out together
And if I could I would turn back the heads of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did...
But now I guess I gotta move on right?
It's still hard &amp; I still love you to this day.

2007,89,Teardrops on My Guitar,Taylor Swift,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"

2007,91,Snow (Hey Oh),Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time

Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say oh, oh

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more, time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside

Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
Come back and hey oh
Look at what I say oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, woah

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

When to descend, to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out

Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Listen what I say oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, woah

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, oh yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh yeah"

Last chance for one last dance

All of hell to hold your hand

2007,96,LoveStoned,Justin Timberlake,"She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's that and she knows
I think that she knows

Now dance
Little girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's that and she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's that and she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned

I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh (repeat 2 more times)

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh

And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked
It just ain't fair, but I...
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh."
2007,97,Better than Me,Hinder,"I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older
'Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
(And I think you should know this)
(You deserve much better than me)"
2007,98,Paralyzer,Finger Eleven,"I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should

This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one

This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

Not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

You'll probably move right through me on my way to you
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you"

C'mon

Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

I ain't never seen none that'll make me go
This crazy all night, spending my dough
Had the million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes, they stole the show

So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinking X&amp;O
Hold up, wait a minute
Do I see what I think I? Whoa

Did I think I've seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain I'm making it snow
Work the pole I got the bank roll

I'm a say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me I gave her mo'
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

Hey shawty, what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans filled with gwap and they're ready for show
It's Cadillacs, Maybach for the sexy grown
Patr√≥n on the rocks that'll make you moan

One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I ain't dealing rubber bands

That's what I told her
Her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over
That Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier
She ready for rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky on me, I was just like clover

Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her

Whoa shawty, yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that

I was on it sexy woman
Let me show it, made me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them ros√© bottles foaming

She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop &amp; lock
Had to break her off that gwap
Gal was fine, just like my glock

2008,2,Bleeding Love,Leona Lewis,"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeah
But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Ooh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

Oh, I keep bleeding love
I keep 
Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love, oh"

Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you

There ain't no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you"

Take a shot for you,

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

Chris Brown
I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground To float to you
With no gravity to hold me down for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don't know how but I don't even care

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

Baby
There's no air, no air
No air, oh!

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
I can't live, I can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
I can't live, I can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

2008,13,Viva la Vida,Coldplay,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"

Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature

I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it

You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go

Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one

This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

Or your place or my place

Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours"

No matter what you say about love, I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later 
I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life, I learn every time I bleed
That truth is a stranger, my soul is in danger 
I gotta let my spirit be free 
To admit that I'm wrong, and then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
(I'll always have you
I'll always have you)

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry, but I've gotta be strong and leave you behind 

I can't waste time, so give it a moment

Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done

I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do

It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands, just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're ""here"" not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'ma run 'til you can't walk
But something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there

2008,37,Live Your Life,T.I. ,"(T.I.)
Ay, this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here
What you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are (Rihanna, let's get it)

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
(Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my prot√©g√©, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

(T.I.)
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still'd grab a nigga by the collar quick

Whoever havin' problems with they record sales, just holla T.I.P.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow T.I.P.
I got love for the game, but ay, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comical

The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
""Where you from? Who you know? What you makin'? What kind of car you in?""
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into ya bank account, and you've up out of poverty

Your values is in disarrayed, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, (ay) my life, (oh) my life (ay)
Just livin' my life, (ay) my life, (oh) my life (ay)

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin,' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin' nowhere

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
And look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
'Til the game end, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot

Livin' the life, my life
In a brand new city, got my whole team wit' me
The life, my life, I do what I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life, I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life and I'm not stopping

So live your life"

Like your sex but more love what cha do
Turn me on how you stare at me when we through
When you give it to me, I don't wanna turn ya loose
Scared to moan around you, all I can say is ""Ooh""

One wit the pink trim on 'em and they light blue
Speakin' for the goons, thank god for makin' you

I juss gave her a nick name, it's wet-wet
'Cause when we finished she mess up all the bedsets
She got somethin' to relax me when I'm under stress
Never told her, or let her know it but she the best
She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you had told me it was this good, I'da never guessed
She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My BUST IT BABY I keep 'er on deck

She got me speedin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor mayne, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang, ask around they know us
They know that's my...
BUSTTTTTT ITTT... bay baby

2008,41,Our Song,Taylor Swift,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is somethin' wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I've heard every hour and listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

2008,43,A Milli,Lil Wayne,"Young Money
Ya dig
Yeah, Mac, I'm going in

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career, this isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil and leak
On the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-ch-ch-ch-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, motherfucka, coppa
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppa's, ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules
If you can't beat 'em, then you prop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop em, 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucka, I'm ill... yeah

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair and coke in her derriere
Like smokin' the thinnest air, I open the Lamborghini
Hopin' them crackers see me like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a motherfuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit, call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch
Call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private
Damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch?
Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
And she ain't shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch
Ha-ha, yeah, nigga, that's my bitch
So when she ask for the money when you through
Don't be surprised, bitch
It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass, you ain't got shit
Motherfucka, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick
Yeah, my drop sick, yeah, my Glock sick
And my knot dick
I'm ill

Motherfucka, I'm ill... yeah, see

They say I'm rappin' like Big, Jay, and Tupac
Andre 3000, where is Erykah Badu at?
Who that? Who that say they gonna beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that wanna do that, boy?
Ya knew that true the swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like you to pay me by the hour, ha-ha
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches like Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucka, I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me
Don't you compare me, 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see but they hear me, they don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy

No more time left to be here

If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for

I don't want to forget the present is a gift
And I don't want to take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again

Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh

How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for

When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Can you do that for me baby?

Every time you touch me
See we don't really know
Touch me like this is the last time
See everyday we never know

Promise that you'll love me
I want you to promise me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Like you'll never see me again

2008,48,Teardrops on My Guitar,Taylor Swift,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"

It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking 'em back

'Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in

Thinking that I deserve it 
Now I realize that I really didn't know

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (Oh yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV 
Without something there to remind me 
Was it all that easy 
To just put aside your feelings 

If I'm dreaming don't wanna let it 
Hurt my feelings but that's the path 
I believe in 
And I know time will heal it 
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything 
Quickly I'm learning to love again

And live my life how it should be

That's why I love her."
2008,58,Fall for You,Secondhand Serenade,"The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before?
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Oh, I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
And you always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed but I have loved you from the start

Oh, but hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Oh, I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's impossible

So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in
I'm yours to keep
And hold onto your words
'Cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight when you're fast asleep

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Oh, I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Oh, I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's just the way you're impossible to find"

2008,60,Say,John Mayer,"Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems
Better put ‚Äòem in quotations

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Walking like a one-man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead
If you could only

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You better know that in the end 
It's better to say too much 
Than never to say what you need to say

Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

Say what you need to say"
2008,61,One Step at a Time,Jordin Sparks,"Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

You believe and you doubt
You're confused, and got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight (when you need to find the strength)
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time

Take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No...)

(Ne-Yo)
But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did

(Rihanna)
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong

(Ne-Yo)
But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

(Rihanna)
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)
And I hate how much I love you boy (ooh whoa...)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (ooh...)

(Ne-Yo)
You completely know the power that you have
The only one that makes me laugh

(Rihanna)
Said and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right

(Ne-Yo)
And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah...)
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so

(Both)
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak...
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me...

(Ne-Yo)
Yeah... ooh...

(Rihanna)
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
That's how much I love you (oh, need you)
That's how much I need you

And I hate that I love you so...

I can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you)

If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Matthew Santos
If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know

Lupe Fiasco
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Matthew Santos
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&amp;M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autographed picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha ha ha ha... ha

Matthew Santos
If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show"

I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive

To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed was there all along
Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun

I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life... my life

I'm a mac to a playa
I'm a stud
'Cause when I leave the club I'm a fuck
Ride with the man and be givin' up the brain
Little skinny I'm a ride wit ya
I don't even know your name
There's a whole lotta room in the front of the van

Like Barack Obama said its time for a change
Put a roll on the back seat
Pop that body now you know that ya got me
You'll find a chick that's kinda classy
Said her name was antine now I'm grabbin'
Got a grip on the whip
Big round booty with the silicone tits
She bouncin' on my lap and she tryin' a own the six
I whispered in her ear its hard for a pimp

Lolli lolli lolli lolli let me see you pop that body
Lolli lolli lolli lolli let me see you pop that body

Poppin' that booty

2008,74,Love Lockdown,Kanye West,"I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, till it's over, love
Till we lose control, system overload
Screamin' no, no, no, no, no

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
No, I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down

2008,78,Big Girls Don't Cry,Fergie,"The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps until I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine
Valentine

Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours, too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket

2008,81,Love Story,Taylor Swift,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's a real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said...

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!""

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you!"

2008,85,All Summer Long,Kid Rock,"It was 1989
My thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in between
It was summertime in northern Michigan

Splashing through the sandbar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Turn it up

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves begin to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

We were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long"

Oh uh
Can't help but wait

I see you, you with him
He ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by while he lies
Then turn right round and forgive

I can't take to see your face
With those tears runnin' down your cheeks
But what can I do
I gotta stay true
Cause deep down I'm still a G

And I don't want to come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl I can't help but wait
Till you get back with him it don't change
Can't help but wait
Till you see that with me it ain't the same
Can't help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can't help but wait

It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You're a queen you should be
Gettin' all that someone's got
You should be rockin' the latest in purses
Bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than that occasional
""I love you, I'm thinking of you""

And I don't wanna come between you and your man no
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

See is believin
And I see what you need so

Let you catch what you've been missing

Till you get back with him it don't change
Can't help but wait
Till you see that with me it ain't the same
Can't help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are

2008,87,In Love with a Girl,Gavin DeGraw,"So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time
And you know he's gonna be there

Backed a border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

After many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones
Without reading innuendos

But you found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifter's run has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Imma tell you what you do to thank you
Practice what you preach
Now I know, there's nothing we can't reach

'Cause a heart can't erase
Once it finds a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away...
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city
Like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fucking reason.
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces. (My life!)
Cause that's Jesus people, and Game he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle (My life!)

Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn I know his mama proud
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like MJB, no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground

With the high beams on
Me and the devil sharing chronic blunts
Listening to The Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, and my Sox hat
I'm Paid in Full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

I remember when I gave up loving you.

I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
I'm sad and lonely.

No one knew all the pain I went through.
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you.
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be.
But you made me leave.
And plus my heart, it just, it kept telling me so.

I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I said I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
So sad and lonely.

There was nowhere else to go, oh.
Nobody else to turn to, no.
For the rest of my life
I promised myself, I will love me first genuinely.

I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.

But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like, ""I love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

I know it was foul, baby, aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain

If somebody woulda told me a year ago, it'll go get this difficult

Like a flight with no visa, first class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

2008,92,7 Things,Miley Cyrus,"One, two, three, four

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear, my dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and it's silent as I wait for you to say
What I need to hear now, your sincere apology
And when you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine, when we're intertwined
Everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do, ohh
You make me love you
Sha, sha
You do, oh"
2008,93,You're Gonna Miss This,Trace Adkins,"She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining, saying ""I can't wait to turn 18""
She said, ""I'll make my own money and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school""
And she kissed her head and said, ""I was just like you""

You're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it, she's a brand new bride
In her one bedroom apartment and her daddy stops by
He tells her it's a nice place, she says it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
And daddy shakes his head and says ""baby, just slow down""

'Cause you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing, one kid's crying, one kid's screaming
And she keeps apologizing, he says ""they don't bother me 
I've got two babies of my own, one's 36, one's 23""
Huh, it's hard to believe

But you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this, yeah, you're gonna miss this"
2008,94,Love Remains the Same,Gavin Rossdale,"A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like lunar landing
You make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

I find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz sounds just like a 'fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
It's all left still to play

We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we're over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change

I, oh I
I wish this could last forever
I, oh I
As if we could last forever

Love remains the same
Love remains the same"
2008,95,Feels Like Tonight,Daughtry,"You, you got me thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me come and take a look inside
You, believe me and every single lie
But I, I failed you this time

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right...

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

I never felt like this before
Just when I leave I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

Cause there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight"

2008,98,Into the Night,Santana ,"Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay

You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes
No room left to move in between you and I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay

2009,5,Love Story,Taylor Swift,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's a real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said...

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!""

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you!"
2009,6,Right Round,Flo Rida,"You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' 'bout clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on, whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on
Then pop in the night 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade away shot 'cause we ballin'
It's Platinum Patr√≥n every hour

Girl you the drink with all that goody power

Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans

My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my (plan)
We buildin' castles that's made out of (sand)

She's amazin', fire blazin'
Hotter than cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze, the bottom is wavin' at me
Like ""Damn it, I know ya.""
You wanna shoot like a gun outta holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your sheaufer

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Yeah, I'm spendin' my money
I'm out of control (hey)
Somebody help me (hey)
She takin' my bank roll

But I'm king of the club
And I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down
Down down down down down down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

2009,7,I'm Yours,Jason Mraz,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours"

Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell)

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song and you sing along
But you never tell (No, never tell)

Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell (It will give you hell)
When you sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell"
2009,11,You Belong with Me,Taylor Swift,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me"
2009,12,Dead and Gone,T.I. ,"T.I.
Hey, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing, I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you pimpin'

Justin Timberlake and Timbaland
Oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead...

T.I.
Ever had one of them days you wish you would've stayed home?
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you get jumped, here that's next
So they don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you're hit 4 times, bullet hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down, now ya wheelchair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Justin Timberlake and Timbaland
Oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)

T.I.
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situations
Could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin' smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now I think about ""Damn, what a life I had""
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door.
Who would've thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
I had done took that ass whippin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
'Cos I hit you and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who me
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today

I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west

2009,13,You Found Me,The Fray,"I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me, to find me?"
2009,14,Use Somebody,Kings of Leon,"I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

Off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat

I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody

(Go and let it out, go and let it out)

Heh, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

Kanye West
Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louis Vuitton it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're servin' on a platter
So what we gon' have, dessert or disaster?

Keri Hilson
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
And you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race
But I already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
(As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin' bout our life our house and kids, yeah
Every mornin' I look at you and smile
'Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

I think I'm gonna kick it wit my girl today, kick it wit my girl today
I used to be commander-in-chief
Of my pimp ship flyin' high, flyin' high)
Till I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky
Oh shot me out the sky

Hate to know I'm crashing, don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss Independent, oh, to the fullest, the load never too much
She helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight

Kanye West
Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happen
So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch?
Whoa, it's me, baby this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'mma ask him

Keri Hilson
Say you gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So will you bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh 'cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa, I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
Whoa, whoa, and if it hits better make it worth the fall
When it comes around

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens, hey
But when it happens you're gonna feel it
Let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down
When it knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it
Let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down

2009,18,Live Your Life,T.I. ,"(T.I.)
Ay, this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here
What you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are (Rihanna, let's get it)

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
(Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my prot√©g√©, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

(T.I.)
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still'd grab a nigga by the collar quick

Whoever havin' problems with they record sales, just holla T.I.P.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow T.I.P.
I got love for the game, but ay, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comical

The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
""Where you from? Who you know? What you makin'? What kind of car you in?""
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into ya bank account, and you've up out of poverty

Your values is in disarrayed, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, (ay) my life, (oh) my life (ay)
Just livin' my life, (ay) my life, (oh) my life (ay)

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin,' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin' nowhere

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
And look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
'Til the game end, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot

Livin' the life, my life
In a brand new city, got my whole team wit' me
The life, my life, I do what I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life, I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life and I'm not stopping

So live your life"

I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

2009,31,Run This Town,Jay-Z ,"Feel it coming in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who goin' run this town tonight
Who goin' run this town tonight
We goin' run this town!

Wassup
Wassup

We are, yeah, I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all-black everything
Black cards, blacks cars, all-black everything
And that girl's a black birds riding with their poop
I get more in-depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down, and I'm tryin' get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Me, I'm talking five, comma, six zeros, got zeros, jigga
Back to running circles round niggas, now we squared up, hold up

Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who goin' run this town tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Who's goin' run this town tonight

We are, yeah, I said it, we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B., we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the God
Peace, God, Ah, ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table screaming, ""Fuck the other side, they jealous""
We got a banquet full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spending no cake
They should throw they hand in 'cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquet is looking like Millionaires' Row
Yeah

Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care

Only thing that's on my mind
Is who goin' run this town tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Who's goin' run this town tonight

It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick, no homo
I bought my whole family whips, no Volvos
Next time I'm in Church, please no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Rav 4
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon want one thing
I can spend my whole life good will hunting
Only good gon come is it's good when I'm coming
She got an ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And I'm feasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn 'bout the drama that you do bring
I'm just tryin' change the color of your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
What's that, Ye? Baby, these heels
Is that a May... what?? Baby, these wheels
You tripping when you ain't sipping, have a refill
You feelin' like you running, huh?

I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher

I must now remind you
Let it rock

He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours

Ah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly,
""Come and play""
Ah, I am falling

2009,44,Love Lockdown,Kanye West,"I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, till it's over, love
Till we lose control, system overload
Screamin' no, no, no, no, no

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
No, I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose, you lose

Oh!
Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world:
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ok! Let's go!

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick frumunda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup, the lady give her eighty some paper cut

Now picture us, it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention, ""It's true""
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen... Dr. Dre!

Dr. Dre
They see that low rider go by, they like, ""Oh, my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that six tre like, ""Sick 'em, Dre""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me

But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again

I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado

The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like precision collision
Or maico, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing... 50 Cent!

50 Cent
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what?
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, Mafucker, I'm grown

I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what? I trick
Fat ass, burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes, I say, ""Move a-bitch, move""

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

2009,48,If I Were a Boy,Beyonc√©,"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy"

On Fifth Avenue
And right now radio's
All that we can hear

Man we ain't talked since we left
It's so overdue
It's cold outside
But between us it's worse in here

The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers

I don't want to try now
All that's lefts goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Everyday several takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you it's hurting me

The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers

I don't want to try now
All that's lefts goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothings wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers

I don't want to try now
All that's lefts goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

But I gotta do it
I gotta do it

I hate this part right here

2009,51,Gotta Be Somebody,Nickelback,"This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of, but dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing; I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene, straight off the silver screen

So I'll be holding my own breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street; out in the moonlight
And, damn it, this feels too right
It's just like d√©j√† vu; me, standing here with you

So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Ooh, you can't give up (when you're looking for) 
A diamond in the rough (because you never know) 
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh...

Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Nobody wants to be the last one there (when you're looking for)
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares (because you never know)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (make sure you're holding on)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there."

How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest
But baby I don't mean it
I mean it, I promise

Please don't leave me

I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this

2009,55,Viva la Vida,Coldplay,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

I'm out here without a shield; can't go back now

Both hands tied behind my back with nothing

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow

And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing

To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every lie
In every truth that you'd deny

And as I say it louder I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why...

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

It came out like a river once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever just pushing it down
Felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to say
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise

If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this, it's easier to see the reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories
The whispering before we sleep, just one more thing that you can't keep
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise"
2009,64,She Wolf,Shakira,"S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in your closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe"

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you

2009,70,If Today Was Your Last Day,Nickelback,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day,
If today was your last day.

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try,
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day...
Would you make your mark
By mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars,
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
'cause the hands of time
Are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late,
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?

Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day"

Drink my beer and smoke my weed

Go out to eat, then do it again

I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club and drink Miller Lite
On thirsty Thursday and Tuesday night ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice

So fill up my cup, lets get fucked up

Like don't pass out with your shoes on

And don't leave the house till the booze gone
And don't have sex if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new joint

Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted

A'ight everybody, I gotta head back to class for a little bit

That party last night was awfully crazy
I wish we taped it (You know whats goin down)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed (You're all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (Bring your friends)
Pass out at 3, wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

Do I really have to graduate, or can I just stay here the rest of my life?"

2009,75,Big Green Tractor,Jason Aldean,"She had a shiny little beamer with the rag top down
Sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
I just laughed and said y'all get in
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
I said whatcha wanna do baby I don't care
We can go to the show or we can stay right here and

I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

I said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fire flies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house or

We can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Mmm just let me dust off the seat
Mmm now put your pretty little arms around me

Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you've got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go to town
Or we can go another round

2009,76,White Horse,Taylor Swift,"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel, comes out, just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth, all this time, 'cause I honestly believed in, you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Try and catch me now oh-oh
It's too late, to catch me now"

2009,78,21 Guns,Green Day,"Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?

Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you've lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn‚Äôt pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You‚Äôre in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight

2009,81,Chicken Fried,Zac Brown Band,"You know I like my chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well, I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in Southern ground

And a little bit o' chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Well, it's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind; this I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit o' chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well, I've seen a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get ya little chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

And three weeks later in the front porch light
Taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight

And I just can‚Äôt believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been
We‚Äôve come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then

You were so surprised
There people around but I didn‚Äôt care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again, I thought I loved you then

I just can‚Äôt believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it‚Äôs ever been

I can just see you with a baby on the way
I can just see you when your hair is turning grey
What I can‚Äôt see is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I‚Äôve said that before

And now you‚Äôre my whole life, now you‚Äôre my whole world

And by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

And she says ooh
I can't take no more

And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
Way down

Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

Till by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
And tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be all right
She'll be all right
Just not tonight

And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
But her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling

I can't take no more

2009,88,Forever,Drake ,"It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first-name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped a mix tape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

Ever, ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams: Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Nah, super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
""Uh, you such a fuckin' loser
You ain't even go to class, Bueller""
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out, and God damn, they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop, like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't want to hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
Uh, uh

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh, no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes, and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you got at me, how's it taste,
When I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?
I'm Hannibal Lector, so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)"

2009,90,I Run to You,Lady Antebellum,"I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slippin' right on through
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

Whoa-oh-whoa
Oh, I run to you

Into a new disaster, so I run to you

2009,91,I Do Not Hook Up,Kelly Clarkson,"Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

Slow motion sparks, you've caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys, oh yes, they will
They don't wanna define it

Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beat
As I kiss your forehead

This may not last but this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with the snap of your finger, oh no

Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your head on my hand, your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
'Cause you don't wanna miss out"
2009,92,Green Light,John Legend ,"I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Working your back like it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
I've got an obsession of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission so just...

Give me the greenlight
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
We can go all night
Give me the greenlight

Then we can get it moving baby
'Cause we know it's gonna be right

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

Do I have a girlfriend... technically no.
If you'll be my girlfriend then I'll make it so
You'll be my only true lover
No competition, no others
Baby it's just the thrill of the chase
But I've got a feeling that I'm winning this race!
Baby I'm in much closer
I just need permission so...

Give me the greenlight...
Give me just one night.
I'm ready to go right now!

So I went hard like Madusa staring at me
I told her let's go, let's blow this lame n**** factory
She said, What type of girl do you think I are
The kind that you meet in a bar
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kinda star
No I'm a comet
I just want you woman
Hey, If I were you then It would be me that I go home with
3, the one and only
One thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl ""ooh he can get it""
Admit it
You did it
Let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kiddin
We both going to where you livin'
HA, I got you gigglin like I'm piglet
Oh that's the ticket
I hope you're more like anita baker than robin givens
No, I don't know that lady so let me quit it
I'm just style freein, freestylin which I seldom do
This is what I'm telling you
To the bed I'm nailing you
Like I've been in jail for two
Years and then they let me loose

Give me the greenlight...
Give me just one night.
I'm ready to go right now!
I'm ready to go right now
We can go all night
Give me the greenlight
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

You got you one legend
Sometimes you gotta step from behind the piano
And let 'em know what's going on
Even Stevie wonder got down sometimes
I'm ready to go

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now"
2009,93,People Are Crazy,Billy Currington,"This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say,
""God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy""

He said ""I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damn if I know""
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said ""These damn things will kill me yet,
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

Last call its 2:00am
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page Obituary
He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh but me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"
2009,94,Whatever It Is,Zac Brown Band,"She got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And the pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people askin' why it is, I tell them I don't know
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

Now when she loves me
Girl, that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me I can live forever
And when she loves me I am untouchable

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you, I do""

It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you
Now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you want to cry
Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough
To let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

Already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

2009,97,Say Hey (I Love You),Michael Franti & Spearhead ,"(This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide)

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)

Only Petron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standin on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was ballin hard it was just the ninth inning (Early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet with my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get in the freak way
SHIT! We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights

2009,99,Pretty Wings,Maxwell,"Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants, no trace
No residual feelings within you
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love you
I hope you feel the same

Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affection
Had to fill out my prescription for the remedy
I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly
The way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to live
I had to live
I had to leave
I had to leave

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To flap your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around

I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into ""like""
Baby believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep till I die a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times
Better days, and I miss you more and more

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To flap your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around"
2009,100,Never Say Never,The Fray,"Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without, just hold a smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time and time again
Younger now then we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Picture: you're the queen of everything
As far as the eye can see, under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand

You can never say never while we don't know it
Time, time and time again
Younger now then we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

We're coming apart but we pull it together
Pull it together, together again

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties

2010,2,Need You Now,Lady Antebellum,"Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone, 'cause I can't fight it any more
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot o' whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
I just need you now

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains 
I knew I wouldn't forget ya
And so I went and let you blow my mind

Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, hey, hey

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny 

I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you; like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
You so gangster; I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey.

Katy Perry
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh

California girls, we're unforgettable (California)
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle (ooh)
Oooh oh oooh

Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most

I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah)

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Katy my lady (yeah)
You looking here baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (oh yeah)

2010,6,Airplanes,B.o.B,"Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion

And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back

But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
And they sayin' ""What would you wish for?""
If you had one chance

So airplane, airplane
Sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank

Yeah back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Then maybe yo maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?

So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
I could really use a wish right now
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now, right now"
2010,7,Love the Way You Lie,Eminem ,"Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Steal your love and leave

She pose like it's for posters
And I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me
She said ""Don't you ever show this""

You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kind of heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece: I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight"
2010,18,Just the Way You Are,Bruno Mars,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah"
2010,19,Cooler Than Me,Mike Posner,"If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say ""hey"" or remember my name, and
It's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow shoes on your feet
And you wear them around like it ain't shh
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Or who you think that you are

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say ""hey"" or remember my name, and
It's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Or who you think that you are

'Cause it sure seems (it sure seems)
You got no doubt (that you got no doubts)
But we all see (we all see)
You got your head in the clouds.

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm (under my arm)
I used up all my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

Yeah, I'm up at Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere

I used to cop in Harlem,  all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot: 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons whippin' pastry

Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but B.K. is from Texas
Now I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard and I brought my boys with me

Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York
I made you hot nigga

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though

Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair they act like they forgot how to add

Eight million stories out there in the naked
City it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me I gotta plug Special Ed ""I got it made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade

Three-dice Cee-lo, three-card Monte
Labor Day parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo, I'm from the Empire State that's

These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York
Welcome to the bright light

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties who sipping life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple Eve

Caught up in the in-crowd
Now you're in-style, and in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them

Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends

Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah
Come on, come
Yeah

In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire

Travie McCoy
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Bruno Mars
Oh, every time I close my eyes
What you see? What you see, bro?
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?
A different city every night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For what?
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh

Travie McCoy
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

Bruno Mars
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
So bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Buy everything
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
What up, Oprah! Ha ha

Oh, every time I close my eyes
What you see? What you see, bro?
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?

2010,24,Not Afraid,Eminem,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) (Yeah) to take a stand (to take a stand) (It's been a ride)
Everybody (I guess I had to) (everybody), come take my hand (Go to that place) (come take my hand) (To get to this one)
We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road"

'Cause when a heart breaks no, it don't break
No it don't break, no it don't break even no

What am I gonna do
When the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up and you're okay?

I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces
(One still in love while the other one's leaving)
I'm falling to pieces
('Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even)

Oh, it don't break even, no
Oh, it don't break even, no
Oh, it don't break even, no"
2010,28,Your Love Is My Drug,Kesha,"Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams

I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hit my head against the wall

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

CHORUS:
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mom's telling me I should think twice
But love to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My esteem is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack-head

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
(All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

So I got a question:
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love, huh your drug?
Your drug, huh your drug
Huh your drug, is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Hey! Hey!
So...
Your love, your love
Your love, your love...
...is my drug
I like your beard"

2010,30,Fireflies,Owl City,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(They said farewell)

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(A jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"

2010,39,Haven't Met You Yet,Michael Bubl√©,"I'm not surprised
Not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times
I've stopped keeping track
I talk myself in
I talk myself out
I get all worked up
Then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I thought of every possibility

And I know someday that it'll all turn out
You make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait
I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing
And the other's half's luck
Wherever you are
Whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility, mhm

And somehow I know that it'll all turn out
And you make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all's fair
And In love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it right and
We'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get
Than I get, than I get, than I get

Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out

2010,46,Mine,Taylor Swift,"You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)

We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say ""I love you,"" enough
Till it's too late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would've done?

Yeah, we gotta stop
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given if
This is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that
Every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or throw it all away
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying

And if you plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
So when we long for absolution, there'll be no one on the line

Like we're dying (x4)

You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till its head on
Why we think we're right when we're dead wrong,
You never know a good thing till it's gone

Run through yo town

Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million

And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got
I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes

I can't just let you run up on me like that (all on me like that)

Go hard or go home
Back to your residence
Soon the red doors get a block back to the presidents
I used to run my old block like Obama did
You don't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then

Couldn't even come in my room
Smell like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playin' casino
Cali's all I keep in my bag in California
Tell them to give me back my swag
They try to clone me

You see my Louis chucks, Louis bag, Louis frames,
Louis belt
What that make me
Louis Mane

I'm in the all white party wearin' all black
With my new black watch called the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac wrist
Yeah, they say they're hard
They ain't hard as this

Hard!

One word describes me
And if I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard

2010,50,Young Forever,Jay-Z ,"Mr Hudson
Let's dance in style
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

Jay-Z
May the best of your today's
Be the worst of your tomorrows
But we ain't even thinking that far
You naw mean?

Jay-Z
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

Jay-Z
Fear not when, fear not why
Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations while debating up in barber shops
Young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on,
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious.
Tear it down,
'Til the sun comes back around

And now we looking so smash
Knocking over trash cans
E'rybody breaking bottles
It's a filthy hot-mess
I'm down to get payed.
I'm not the designated driver so
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't
Oh!

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

Oh Oh Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh... 
Everybody take it off!
Oh Oh Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh...
Everybody take it off

Right now, take it off 
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Ohhh...woah

Right now, take it off 
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
(Oh...) Everybody take it off

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around

It's a dirty free-for-all

2010,60,Over,Drake,"I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

All right bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker

Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones
Bitch I run it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now. man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame

And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer

But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on

They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over"

You, you got something all the girls want...

Uh... uh, yo...
He the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym,
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

Anyway, I think I met him sometime before,
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve,
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him,
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me ""Mama"", ""Lil' Mama"", I call him ""Baby""...

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam...
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam;
I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland...

Anyway, I think I met him in the sky;
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon...
Konvict! Just like Akon,
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the Jake-on...

2010,67,Party in the U.S.A.,Miley Cyrus,"I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio 
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I‚Äôm noddin‚Äô my head like, yeah

They're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

Feel like hopping on a flight (on a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
Something stops me every time (every time)

You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)

I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm bout to throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)

Uh, Use to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care but I ain't get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind
Fuck it let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin
Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, whatchu trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)

Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complain
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, She give me deja vu
And all that attitude, I don't care 'bout it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear 'bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin up the deuce now

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)

You and me
Or three
Or four
On the floor

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between, countin'

One, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3-P
Everybody loves ooh, shoutin'

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees

2010,70,Impossible,Shontelle,"I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know (I know)

And know when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Ooh impossible (yeah yeah)

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

2010,71,Forever,Drake ,"It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first-name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped a mix tape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

Ever, ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams: Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Nah, super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
""Uh, you such a fuckin' loser
You ain't even go to class, Bueller""
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out, and God damn, they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop, like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't want to hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
Uh, uh

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh, no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes, and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you got at me, how's it taste,
When I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?
I'm Hannibal Lector, so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mine (ever mine, ever mine)"

You came into my life
And I thought hey
You know this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one

I remember every look upon your face,
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
And finally now, believing

And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one

You came into my life
And I got high

Maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking ooh I can't live without you

And twist, and twist

Well my first kiss went a little like this
And twist, and twist

I said no more teachers
And no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers
Just hoping that nobody looks

Lips like licorice
Tongue like candy
Excuse me miss
But can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my lips
(I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say

Well my first kiss went a little like this

I said no more sailors
And no more soldiers
With your name in a heart
Tattoo upon his shoulders

Your kiss is like whiskey
It gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning
With the taste of your tongue

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my lips

Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you
Now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you want to cry
Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough
To let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

Already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

Cash Money goldmine, Weezy stay loyal
Boy, we getting money like we just found oil
Uh and that's word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bed rash
And I just tell 'em to loaf it when the bread pass
Staring at you from the top of the game man
I might drop the world, if I change hands
Uh it feel good to be here, Weezy in the building, got this bitch rebuilt

Absolutely no one that knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together?
When everybody, everybody said we never would
And just when I, I start to think they're right
That love has died

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in

Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right, fight about it all night
Had enough
You give me that look
""I'm sorry baby let's make up""
You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again

You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand
And you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make
Everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense
Till the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way

2010,85,Say Something,Timbaland ,"Drake (Chorus)
This shit was all I knew,
You and me only,
And I did it all for you,
Still you were lonely,
We coulda worked it out,

Uh, but I guess things change,
Its funny how someone else's success brings pain,
When ya no longer involved that person has it all,
And you just stuck standing there,

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby,
Say something baby,
Say something baby,
I'm gonna need you to say something baby,
Say something baby,
Say something baby,

(Timbaland)
Yeah,
Ever since I've been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
Your life is good but me and you it's catastrophe,
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed,
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
The more money I made you acting like my enemy,
Its crazy, I can't help it if you feel ashamed,
Lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
How can something so familiar be so strange,
Closest friends get estranged when the status change,
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
And my whole wild ... is the only one that had my back,
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don't match,
Is it the money, want me to give it back,

(Drake)
Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
Lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
To a condo downtown because it's all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life,
You shoulda been here to kick it with me,

We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy,
Killing shit the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
How I go from being the man that you argue with,
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
But I'm addicted to this life it's gonna be hard to quit,
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
'Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?"

Every night I rest in my bed 
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you 
When I close my eyes 
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hand and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this? 

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

Off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat

I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody

(Go and let it out, go and let it out)

There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad

Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always going to be the same
Oh, no, you'll never change

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack

I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it

2010,91,The House That Built Me,Miranda Lambert,"I know they say you can't go home again.
I just had to come back one last time.
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam.
But these handprints on the front steps are mine.
And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar.
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years.
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines.
Plans were drawn, concrete poured,
And nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can.
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me."
2010,92,If I Die Young,The Band Perry,"If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh, oh oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, you know
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep them in your pocket
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them, oh

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls"
2010,93,The Only Exception,Paramore,"When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist, but darling

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Well, maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing"
2010,94,American Honey,Lady Antebellum,"She grew up on a side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good
She grew up slow
Like American honey

Steady as a preacher
Free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin'
But wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Get caught in the race
Of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yea

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey

Ooh There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin's sweeter than summertime
And American honey
And American honey"
2010,95,King of Anything,Sara Bareilles,"Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside

So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by

You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked

So let me thank you for your time
And try not to waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast

I hate to break it you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Oh...

You sound so innocent
All full of good intent
You swear you know best

But you expect me to
Jump up on board with you and ride off into your delusional sunset

I'm not the one who's lost
With no direction, oh
But you'll ever see

You're so busy makin' maps
With my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

All my life
I've tried
To make everybody happy while I
Just hurt
And hide
Waitin' for someone to tell me it's my turn
To decide

Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Who cares if you disagree
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Let me hold your crown, babe
Oh oh, ooh
Ah..."
2010,96,Life After You,Daughtry,"Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong but you already know
Believe me I won't stop at nothin' 
To see you so I've started runnin'

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time
Oh why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you"
2010,97,Smile,Uncle Kracker,"You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler then the flip side of my pillow, that's right

Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
Let me know that it's okay, yeah it's okay
And the moments when my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack 
And just like that
You steal away the rain and just like that

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Ohh, you make me smile

Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

(Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile

(Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile"

Back of the party I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick redbone
She do her dougie and all them bitches hatin' but I'm bout
To escape with a bitch and head home (fuck it)
She got her friends so it's a two man and
And I wanna run it even if her legs long
She like you hubby, I think she love me but
I change da subject and I do my dougie
'Cause, I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, smooth, hef in the back with playboy bunnies
We gon make 'em do the dougie in the middle of da bed
And when I asked for some head da bitch looked at me funny
Daaah! bitch you can't tell me nothin' starr made the beat
I just took it out the oven, I just see the dougie when everybody
Clubbin and I hate skinny jeans 'cause da burner keep rubbin'!"
2010,99,Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart,Alicia Keys,"Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

And all the time you were tellin' me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right till the end Ooh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love

And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you"
2010,100,"Lover, Lover",Jerrod Niemann,"Well, the truth, well, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back

Broke up before I get to go and I got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin' you got to do what's right

Whoa, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Whoa, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Well, the truth, yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back

Broke up before I get to go and I got to say
There was a time, oh, woman when you used to shake it for me
But now all you do is treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more, gonna walk out the door

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
No good no more, more, more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Yea, yeah, yeah

Well, I went with you on a starry night
And I'm hurtin' too bad 'cause you don't treat me right
Oh, woman oh, woman, you know I love you so
But you're just so mean to me, baby, I'm walkin' out the door

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
No good no more, more, more

I know you used to love me in every way,
But now I'm givin' up and I'm tired of cryin', babe
I can't stand it no longer, it hurts me to say
But I'm packin' up my bags and goin' far away

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
(Treat me good no more)

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
