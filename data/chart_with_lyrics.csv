2000,1,Breathe,Faith Hill,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe, just breathe
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way"

All right, oh, oh, oh

It's amazing how you knock me off my feet, hmm
Every time you come around me I get weak, oh yeah
Nobody ever made me feel this way, oh
You kiss my lips and then you take my breath away
So I wanna know

I wanna know what turns you on

2000,5,Everything You Want,Vertical Horizon,"Somewhere there's speaking, it's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
And now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why

And I don't know why
Why
And I don't know"

Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, see you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago you said you just got in the house

It's so hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie?
You caught up in your game, you cannot say my name

2000,7,I Knew I Loved You,Savage Garden,"Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I've found you

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

(I knew I loved you before I met you) Ooh
(I knew I loved you)
(I knew I loved you before I met you) Ooh

2000,8,Amazed,Lonestar,"Every time our eyes meet
This feelin' inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh, it feels like the first time everytime
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Oh, every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you"
2000,9,Bent,Matchbox Twenty,"And if I fall along the way
Pick me up and dust me off
And if I get too tired to make it
Be my breath so I can walk

And if I need some other love, then
Give me more than I can stand
And when my smile gets old and faded
Wait around I'll smile again

Shouldn't be so complicated
Just hold me and then
Oh, just hold me again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

And if I couldn't sleep, could you sleep?
Could you paint me better off?
And could you sympathize with my needs?
I know you think I need a lot

I started out clean but I'm jaded
Just phoning it in
Oh, just breaking the skin

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

Start bending me
It's never enough till I feel all your pieces
Start bending me
Keep bending me until I'm completely broken in

Shouldn't be so complicated
Just touch me and then
Oh, just touch me again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me landin' without understanding
Hell, I'd go there again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Yeah, you're breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent"
2000,10,He Wasn't Man Enough,Toni Braxton,"Darkchild, Toni Braxton
Darkchild yeah

Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don'tcha know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you react like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first!

What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Then I'd be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl,
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't buy
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Then I'd be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Oh yeah, so many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me"
2000,11,Higher,Creed,"When dreaming
I'm guided to another world
Time and time again

At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave
The comfort of this place

'Cause there's a hunger
A-longing to escape
From the life I live, when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams

But my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make
The earth and my dreams the same

The only difference is
To let love replace
All our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

So let's go there
Let's go there
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Up high, I feel like I'm
Alive for the very first time
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?"

What would you do to get to me?
What would say to have your way?

Now would you be yourself or play a role?
Tell all the boys or keep it low?

Or play me off or would you stay, oh

2000,15,Kryptonite,3 Doors Down,"Well I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a-holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down

You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a-holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

No no no no no no

And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe

Never would have made it very far

If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the dark night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just till the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you

Ooh

Listen

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune, still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

So, I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
Said without you girl, ahh listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday, you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year, winter summer spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin', ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
That without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything
To hear you say that you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (all the women)
All the expensive cars (all the money)
All of the money don't amount to you (you can have it all)

I can make believe I have everything (just give me my baby)
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete (alright, alright, alight, alright)

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (I don't have you)
All the expensive cars (I don't have you)
All of the money don't amount to you (it makes me wanna cry)

I can make believe I have everything

It's an uphill climb and I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you, yeah
Don't surrender 'cause you can win
In this thing called love

Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

When you question me for a simple answer
I don't know what to say, no
But it's plain to see if you stick together
You're gonna find a way, yeah

When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt

And loneliness starts to call (Loneliness starts to call)

Guilty roads to an endless love (Endless love)

You give me such a vibe
It's totally bonafide

It's not the way you walk
And it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got
That keeps me satisfied

Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch it means so much

It's you I'm always thinking of

2000,35,Absolutely (Story of a Girl),Nine Days,"This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises, never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this shit day after day?
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today?
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Her pretty face, she hid from the world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles
When she smiles"

Good idea
Break a promise to your mother

Turn around
Your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around your back on each other
What a good idea

I remember the stupid things
The mood rings
The bracelets and the beads
Nickels and dimes
Yours and mine
Did you cash in all your dreams
You don't dream for me
No
But I still feel you pulsing like sonar
From the days in the waves
That girl is like a sunburn
I would like to save
She's like a sunburn"
2000,44,I Need You,LeAnn Rimes,"(Ty Lacy/Dennis Matkosky)

I don't need a lot of things
I can get by with nothing
Of all the blessings life can bring
I've always needed something
But I've got all I want
When it comes to loving you
You're my only reason
You're my only truth

I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you

You're the hope that moves me
To courage again
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds, rage
And it's so amazing
'Cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now
'Cause you've brought me too far

I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you
Oh yes I do

I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
And it carries me through
I need you
Oh yes I do
I need you"

2000,51,The Real Slim Shady,Eminem,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ahh!)

It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!)

Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for <span class=""plainlinks"">Tom Green</span> to hump a dead moose

""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to <span class=""plainlinks"">Britney Spears</span>?
Yo shit, <span class=""plainlinks"">Christina Aguilera</span> better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe""

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' ""I don't give a fuck""
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I married the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the other side

Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
She wants to know ""Am I still a slut?""
I gotta take it on the other side

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soulmate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I gotta take it on the other side

Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever

How long, how long
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slitting my throat, it's all I ever"

Pero me hacía falta escuchar de nuevo
Aunque sea un instante tu respiración
Disculpa sé que estoy violando nuestro juramento
Sé que estás con alguien que no es el momento
Pero hay algo urgente que decirte hoy
Me estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte
Agonizando, muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuélveme mis fantasías
Mis ganas de vivir la vida
Devuélveme el aire
Cariño mío, sin ti yo me siento vacío
Las tardes son un laberinto
Y las noches me saben...
A puro dolor

Quisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla
Que no me ha afectado lo de tu partida
Pero con un dedo no se tapa el sol
Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte
Agonizando, muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuélveme mis fantasías
Mis ganas de vivir la vida
Devuélveme el aire
Cariño mío, sin ti yo me siento vacío

Sitting here wondering how the hell
Did I let you leave

Of things to deceive you
I'm just trying to get an understanding
Of what to do
'Cause I'm half way going crazy
Girl they can't fade me

He can't love you like I love you

If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can

That I
Never met someone to make me feel
Like I'm ready to love
So I
Gotta do what I gotta do
Just to keep you
Keep you here with me baby
Now I feel it's time for me to say
That I need you boo
And I can go a day without your lovein

Just thinkin' of someone else in between your thighs
And you thought you were slick had tricks up your sleeve
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
That's why I say

When we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another

I don't wanna be with you put that on everything I own
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
If I never see you again I won't be mad at all
'Cause I believe that you are my downfall

(You did me wrong) you did me wrong I thought you were true (yeah)
You ran out of my life and now I'm so through with you
I wanted you to be there right here with me oh

We can't stand one another

It's really over baby
(Cause you did me wrong) you did me wrong I thought you were true
You ran out of my life and now I'm so through with you

I remember when you used to sit there
I would hold you in my arms and you would say to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I would rub your body you would say to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
When we were together you'd say

2000,64,I Wish,Carl Thomas,"It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
And she got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Even you win
Someone has to lose

(Chorus (with some adlibbing))
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

(Chorus (with some adlibbing))
Oh met her at all
Even though I love her so
She's got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

I wish I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain
If I never met her at all, at all, at all
She still belongs to someone else
Wish I never, wish I never"

Me and my niggas be rollin'
Schemin' on you and your homies
The very first day of summer
All chromed out in a Hummer baby
Hit the park and parlay
Hopin' that you walk this way
Do you and your girls wanna ride
Play all day and puff on the la

I'm diggin' you and I'm feelin' u
U know what's up
Said I'm diggin' you I'm wantin' u
So tell me what's up

(Verse two)
Peep her thighs aand I'm zonin'
Right around two in the mornin'
Looking fly with a sundress on
Think I feel a bone comin' on

Waitin' all day and I'm hopin'
Baby don't front
Back seat Jeep, u know what I want"

2000,67,Only God Knows Why,Kid Rock,"I've been sittin' here, tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself, I need to rewind myself
Lookin' for the payback, listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me

And I feel like number one, yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son, and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills, it helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same

Everybody knows my name, they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me, it's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay, to be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love

And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand 'bout the shit that I've been through
It's been so long, since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long

Maybe I forgot, all the things I miss
Oh somehow I know there's more to life than this
I said it too many times, and I still stand firm
You get what you put in, and people get what they deserve

Still I ain't seen mine, no I ain't seen mine
I've been giving just ain't been gettin', I've been walking that there line
So I think I'll keep on walking, with my head held high
I'll keep moving on and only God knows why

Only God, only God
Only, God knows why
Only God, knows, why why why
Only God knows why

Take me to the river
Hey won't you take me to the river
Hey hey hey"

She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never compromises
Loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful?
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the President

Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me, hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the President
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her lies
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna live this life

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite, unusual
You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body - unusual

Meet Virginia- I can't wait to
Meet Virginia- Yeah-ey eh eh eh eh

Well she wants to be the Queen

When the money ran out and the engine blew.
Hung my tears out to dry,
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky.

And I, I was walkin' the clouds.
Feelin' so safe and sound.
Somethin' else knocks me down.

Well, oh, that's the way it is!

The only problem is you don't feel a thing.
Well I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense.

I'm glad we're on this one way street, just you and I 
Just you and I

All:
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I,

'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again
Shane:
All over again 

Shane:
Some people say
That everything has got its place in time
Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buying
'Cause in your eyes
I see a love that burns eternally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You'll know I'm not lying
 
Sure there'll be times we wanna say goodbye, but even if we try
There are some things in this life won't be denied
Won't be denied

All:
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

Mark:
The more I know of you is the more I know I love you
And the more that I'm sure I want you forever and ever more
And the more that you love me, the more that I know
Oh that I'm never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know that I

All:
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain

And I swear it all over again

2000,77,From the Bottom of My Broken Heart,Britney Spears,"""Never look back,"" we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead,
Emptiness behind
Where do I go?

And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you now?
Still I miss you somehow...

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love,
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love
Till there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

""Baby,"" I said,
""Please stay. Give our love a chance for one more day""
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about

But you put a dart
Through my dreams
Through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now...

""Never look back,"" we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?"
2000,78,Crash and Burn,Savage Garden,"When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please to tame your wild wild heart
I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you can't take anymore

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one way street
With the monsters in your head
When hopes and dreams are far away and
You feel like you can't face the day

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

'Cause there has always been heartache and pain
And when it's over you'll breathe again
You'll breathe again

When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild wild heart

(Chorus X4... until fade)"
2000,79,Yes!,Chad Brock,"She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny

Oh, and we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Oh, then I asked her, can I see you again

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me

Oh, then it happened one night, looking in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question, much to my surprise

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So we called the preacher, family and friends
And nothing's been the same since she said yes
I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
She said yes"
2000,80,The Best Day,George Strait,"We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back

When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
About the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now it's me and her
Watching you and mom I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life

I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life"
2000,81,Where I Wanna Be,Donell Jones,"(Verse one)
I just left my baby girl a message, said I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
'Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time

I could be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her
But I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how, I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

(Verse two)
Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
Think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone but I
Have to find what life is like without you"
2000,82,How Do You Like Me Now?!,Toby Keith,"I was always the crazy one
Who broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number
On the fifty yard line
You were always the perfect one
And a valedictorian
So under your number I wrote
Call for a good time
I only wanted to get your attention
But you over looked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!

When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
You never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into the money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin' who could that be singin'
It's me baby with your wake up call

How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!
 
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way

2000,83,My Best Friend,Tim McGraw,"I never had no one that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life

It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You stand by me
And you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

You're my best friend

You're more than a lover

2000,84,Broadway,Goo Goo Dolls,"Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls

Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world
Like it's someplace that you've been

You see you'd love to run home
But you know you ain't got one
'Cause you're livin' in a world that
You're best forgotten, around here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the loser's day parade

You see you'd love to run home
But you know ain't got one
'Cause you're livin' in a world
That you're best forgotten
When you're thinkin' of a joke
Ain't nobody gonna listen
To the one small point
I know they've been missin' round here

A little bit weaker than you used to be

2000,86,Don't Think I'm Not,Kandi,"Now I don't have to question
Where you were last night
'Cause I already know what you will say
I already know you lie
But I can't be mad at ya
'Cause there's something that you don't know
That when you're gone I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're doggin' me

When you're out in the club
Don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love
Don't think I'm not
When you're feelin' good in somebody's spot
Gettin' hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not
'Cause I'm out gettin' mine

When I try to get your attention
You ignore me every time
You were so caught up doin' your dirt
That you didn't notice mine
Well I couldn't put up with your schemin'
And I couldn't put up with your lies
They say that two wrongs won't make it right
But it's suiting me just fine

Don't be surprised to know
That sometimes women play the field
You may not believe it
But it's real, the game is so real
So real, so real
Oh, don't think we won't do it
When you're out in the club"
2000,87,I Hope You Dance,Lee Ann Womack,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance..........

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance
I hope you dance....I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone)

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,

I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance..

Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

We always said someday, somehow
We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town

What about now, how 'bout tonight
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now

We've been puttin' this off baby long enough
Just give me the word, and we'll be kickin' up dust
We both know it's just a matter of time
Till our hearts start racin' for that county line

Love is nothing but the time it takes to say I'm on your mind
Let me tell you, I'm always there oh yeah

I never thought that give and take
Mentality was right for me, mmm
You made me open up and see
That it's for real
And there's no other place I'd rather be

Think about you all the time
24-7 babe
The love I have inside for you
Is more than any words can say
Pray to God on bended knee
We'll always be together babe

If there's a high or low
Anything can be babe
I'll be there for you
Pick you up off your feet, yeah
Pray to God on bended knee
We'll always be together babe
You and me

When I'm in my nine to five
I smile across my lips when I
Daydream about the night before
I count the minutes till I'm in your arms once more
My friends they don't understand, no
In me they see a brand new man
I give you props and tell them that
My shorty's 'bout it
She personifies the love she gives

Oh how I've waited for this moment in my life
It's you that I adore
Baby with you I am secure
My life is in your hands
And now I understand
What it means to be in love again, oh
Never gonna let you go, oh no

In a blanket made of stars

I want to look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I want to be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile

Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowing inside me like never before
Your love for me something I didn't see
But baby, I know better now
When you walked in the room that very night
A special feeling just burst inside
It was only you, nobody else but baby,
I know better now

Don't wanna love you, if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now
But it wouldn't be right if I (if I)
Didn't tell you this tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And now you're back inside my house again
I'm trying deeply to explain
'Cause baby I wanna get it on
And baby, you're the one for me
And now that I have got you all alone
After all this talking on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong

There was something in your eyes made me realize
Now I hear voices deep inside telling me, telling me it's you and I

2000,99,Waiting for Tonight,Jennifer Lopez,"Like a movie scene, in the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips, on my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I never thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long

With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance?
Five-hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had
And me

But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?(feet?)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
Tell me did you sail across the sun?

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star?

Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you, is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
And then you handed me your towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life

And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better, worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Or take your crown, never

Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I've always known
That you were there upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I've longed for you my love forever

Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

While he was braggin'
I was comin' down the hill just a-draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid all the bills about a month too late

2001,14,It's Been Awhile,Staind,"It's been awhile since I could hold my head high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

It's been awhile since I can say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile since I could say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry"

This is why we could never be

2001,21,Drive,Incubus,"Sometimes
I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear
Take the wheel and steer

It's driven me before and seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal

Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there

So, if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive? Aah ah ooo

It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find
That when I drive myself my light is found

Saturday night was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five, six strippers trying to work for a buck

And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lila, she went to junior high with me
I said: ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot has changed since I've seen you last"", she said

(What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money)

(And his daddy's gone, somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life, mmm)

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
But that's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said: ""Everyday I wake up hoping to die""

She said: ""Nigga, I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I'd done been through more shit you can't even relate to""

Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder

Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it, need some knee
Pads, it happened for a reason, one can't be
Mad, so know this, know that everything's cool

You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
You got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And then you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Talking about jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating, beating, and to the G they be the same thing
So who you be placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

2001,29,Butterfly,Crazy Town,"Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So, to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try

Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passing, I'm asking, ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so, yo, I'm putting it down

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew till I met you

See, I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, parole, the police files

So, yo
What's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down a few dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey, sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy

So sexy, almost evil
Talk about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So, butterfly, here is a song
And it's sealed with a kiss and a ""Thank you, miss.""

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So, come and dance with me, uh-huh, uh-huh

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, uh-huh, uh-huh

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me"

2001,32,I Hope You Dance,Lee Ann Womack,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance..........

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance
I hope you dance....I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone)

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.

Dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance..

2001,37,Fill Me In,Craig David,"All right (Something to say)
All right (Can you fill me in?)
C'mon
Can you fill me in? (What you want, what you want do, yeah)
Can you fill me in? (Let's talk about it)

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She'd phone, say ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door, you were standing
With a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin, lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me 'bout jacuzzi, sounded interesting, so we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
""Please leave a message after the tone""

I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?
Calls diverted to answerphone, red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return, jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in?"" (It's another one, it's another one)

Whenever the coast was clear, and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door, I was standing
With the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down, bounce bounce to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Saying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out with the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?
Wearing a jacket: whose property? Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (You told me)
Can you fill me in?"" (Can you fill me in?)

All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby (Craig David)
Watching your every move
Think some day they might approve? Baby

Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
Calls diverted to answerphone, red wine bottle half the contents gone (Ooh yeah)
Midnight return, jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"

2001,41,All or Nothing,O-Town,"I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over

It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right, I know it, know it

Don't make me promises
Baby you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life

Was hurtin' 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them

Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em

Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky

Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law

I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight

I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all...""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth marked jeans, take that off

Yeah, save the narrative, you savin' it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you savin' it for karats
You wanna see how far I'ma go
How, much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Crist', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound

Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies

And with all this cash [mo' money, mo' problems]
You'll forget your man

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Ro-mancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah, to Club Amnesia

You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me, Hov'!

Where the road goes
Where the day flows
Only time
And who can say
If your love grows
As your heart chose
Only time

Who can say
Why your heart sighs
As your love flies
Only time
And who can say
Why your heart cries
When your love lies
Only time

Who can say
When the roads meet
That love might be
In your heart.
And who can say
When the day sleeps
If the night keeps
All your heart.

Night keeps all your heart

Who can say
If your love grows
As your heart chose
Only time

Where the road goes
Where the day flows

2001,60,I Do!!,Toya,"He was a 6 foot stallion say the storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpatatin' every time he came near
He had a spankin new Range sport a tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his hair was corn-rowed
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

'Cause I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

Me and my crew started groovin made our way to the floor
It's time activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me I felt fingertips
On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin' hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this thug my man that I can tell you, for sure

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

'Cause I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Now watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin' all the pappi's want me but all I want is you

(I do)

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll

But everything about you is so irresistible

Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
It makes weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire
I know I meant to say no...

But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I just can't stop myself falling (falling)
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't wanna play no game (No)

Come home late
It seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So if you want some lovin', I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
Day to Day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve, God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through 'cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse
See I ...

Heard it all before (heard it all before)
All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk
""Baby"" this, ""Baby"" that
But your lies ain't working out
Look who's hurting now?
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down
Played the fool before (played the fool before)
I was your fool I believed in you
Yes I did yes I did
But your lies ain't working out, look who's hurting now?
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down

What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Got me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do
And there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out
I am no longer concerned
See I...

Heard it all before (heard it all before)
""Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think""
That's what you said to me
But your lies ain't working out, look who's hurting now?
See I had to shut you down (had to shut you down)
I had to shut you down

You got a good game I must admit, I was it, but now it's over
But your lies ain't working out, look who's hurting now?
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down

Use to hang on to your every word (every word)
But the more you lie to me the more I hurt
The things you use to say would sound so sweet (sound so sweet)
I was naive
Quick to believe

Heard it all before
""I was at work. It wasn't my car you saw. Baby, I swear it wasn't me!""
But your lies ain't working out, look who's hurting now?
See I had to shut you down (down)

But your lies ain't working out, look who's hurting now? (now)
See I had to shut you down
I had to shut you down

Heard it all before
You know you messed up (You got to know you messed up)
You got to go now, say what you want
But your lies ain't working out, look who's hurting now?
See I had to shut you down (down, down, down, down)

2001,65,The Space Between,Dave Matthews Band,"You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between
Our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time

The space between"

And the dreams we left behind,
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get,
To have you in my life,

When I look back on these days,
I look and see your face,
You were right there for me.

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,

I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,

Well you showed me how it feels,
To feel the sky within my reach,
And I always will remember all,
The strength you gave to me,
Your love made me make it through,
Oh I owe so much to you,
You were right there for me.

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,

I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,

'Cause I always saw you in my light, my strength,
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways,
You were right there for me, you were right there for me
You were right there for me,
For always

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,

Ever since the first moment I spoke your name
From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change cause

So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joy and hurt
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

Many days I've longed for you
Wanting you


Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your touch, your feel, your essence
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real
With no doubts and no fears
And no questions

At first you didn't mean that much to me
But now I know that you're all I need
The world looks so brand new to me
Now that I found love
Everyday I live for you
And everything that I do
I do it for you
What I say is how I feel so believe it's true
You got to know I'm true"

The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
Right now I think you see
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me"

2001,73,I'm Already There,Lonestar,"He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
And when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
She said Daddy when you coming home?
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said, I really miss you darlin'
Don't worry about the kids
They'll be all right
Wish I was in your arms
Lyin' right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that I share?
Oh I'm already there

We may be a
Thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you
Wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh I'm already there

2001,75,Beautiful Day,U2,"The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town

You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend, a hand
In return for grace

It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination

You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Oh

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood, all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have, you don't need it now
What you don't know, you can feel it somehow
What you don't have, you don't need it now
Don't need it now

It's a beautiful day"
2001,76,Austin,Blake Shelton,"She left without leaving a number 
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin 
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year 
Before she called him up,
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If your calling 'bout the car, I sold it,
If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling
If you got something to sell
Your wasting your time
I'm not buying
If it's anybody else
Wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin 
I still love you.

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kinda man would hang on that long
What kinda love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night,
I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake 
And I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back
When I get home 
On Sunday afternoon,
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

This time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone
On Sunday evening
And this is what he hear

If you're calling 'bout my heart
It's still yours
I shoulda listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have
Taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell this is Austin
And I still love you
...I still love you"

2001,78,Grown Men Don't Cry,Tim McGraw,"I pulled into the shopping center
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother.
Like ice cream melting, they embraced,
Years of bad decisions running down her face.
All mornin' I'd been thinking my life's so hard,
And they wore everything they owned, living in a car.
I wanted to tell 'em it would be okay,
But I just got in my Suburban and I drove away.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.

Keep having this dream about my old man,
I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand.
We're talking on the front porch
Watching the sun go down,
But it was just a dream.
He was a slave to his job
And he couldn't be around.
So many things I want to say to him,
But I just placed a rose on his grave,
And I talked to the wind.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry.

I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life.
We say grace, and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for.
Then its up the stairs and off to bed
And my little girl says,
""I haven't had my story, yet.""
And everything weighing on my mind disapears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says,
""I love you, dad!""

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry."

So when I make a big mistake
When I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be all right
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowin'
I will be just fine
'Cause nothin' changes who I am

Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky.
One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
For the first time in my life.
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice.

To this day I still taste that first kiss.
How I prayed it wouldn't end,
And in a way seeing you like this
I guess it never really did.

A wish was granted just for me,
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished, for one more day with you.

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you.

--- Instrumental ---
One more day.

First thing I'd do, is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone
And keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do, with one more day with you.

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you.

(To every city, every hood and every block)
I wish, I wish
(Ghetto America)
I wish, I wish, I wish,
I wish, I wish, I wish

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped to say what's up
And let you know your baby boy ain't doin' so tough
Even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night cryin' tears
Just thinkin' about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin'on this Hennessy
And remember we'd brag on how rich we would be
To get out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know
The half
I would give it all up just to take on ride with you
How I used to kick it on the front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
With you
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say
Boy, you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me
Shootin' this real shit off like a gun
Mmmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a
Bentley and a house
That's why
Fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass player get a real player hatin'em
""Honey Love"" goes platinum and y'all ass come 'round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is goin' down

And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride with you
How I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends
With you
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn... my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head
Be tellin' me to come to church
Say the lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows
Black-tinted like a hearse
But waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans

And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to street perform on Friday
With you and how I'd go to church on
Easter Sunday
With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish"
2001,88,It's a Great Day to Be Alive,Travis Tritt,"I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three-day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's goofy thing but I just gotta say, ""Hey
I'm a-doin' alright""

Yeah, I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink- nor drug-induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?
Aw, yeah

It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best, and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in the mirror, and what do I see?
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth, but harmless as can be
Lord, I guess he's doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?

Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon
Awoo
Awoo

Well, I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three-day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?
Awoo"

The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time

There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancing is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
The way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor

But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you

I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why you're treating me so bad (Treat me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me
And I was all you had (All you had)
And though my heart is beatin' for ya
I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way
And still I stay

See, when I'm home, I'm all alone
And you are always gone (Always gone)
And boy, you know I really love you
I can't deny
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears
After all these years

(Ohh)
I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad what love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
To all of my ladies (Ladies)
Feel me, come on, sing with me

See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to 'preciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me?
Leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up
Lookin' out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
There's somethin' always hold me back"

I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious
Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience
I'm lookin' for the right time to shoot my steam
Lookin' for the right time to flash them keys

Then, um, I'm leavin' please believe in
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check in, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons
Penthouse, rooftop, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve and no teasin'

I need you to get up, up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for
'Cause I feel like bustin' loose and I feel like touchin' you
And can't nobody stop the juice, so baby, tell me, what's the use?
I said

I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Oh, it's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles?
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' sportscars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, I do a hundred, top down and goggles

Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause baby I can't talk it

Warm, sweatin', it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank-top on at this point
You're with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun

So take it off like you're home alone
You know, dancin' in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, girl, I think my ass gettin' big

It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)

Let it just fall out
I like it when ya...
Girl, baby make it...

Stop pacin', time wastin'
I got a friend with a pole in the basement (What?)
I'm just kiddin' like Jason (Oh)
Unless you gon' do it

Extra, extra, spread the news
Check it: Nelly took a trip from the lunar to Neptune
Came back with somethin' thicker than fittin' in sasoons
Say she like to think about cuttin' in restrooms

It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes

2002,5,Wherever You Will Go,The Calling,"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will

No, run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go"
2002,6,A Thousand Miles,Vanessa Carlton,"Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these 
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me 
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you, oh, oh

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight"
2002,7,In the End,Linkin Park,"(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"

2002,9,U Got It Bad,Usher,"Oh, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found 
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song, then baby

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm-)

Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song

Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm you girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found 
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad, hey

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
(Look at yourself)
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about

Showed you when to run away

For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

When the tide comes
I'd take you away

If you want to

I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted
Was somebody who cares

I'm sinking slowly

When did our light turn from green to red?
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again

I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to what I think is safe

And I'm trying to escape

I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

I'm looking down
Now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace

I cried out, ""Heaven save me""
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

I'm so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's something left for me
So please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me
For you and me
For you and me

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking

The lucky fact of your existence

To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
There over, here under
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes they're for no other
They didn't even cry a river

There's nothing left to fear
If you really think the way I feel

Condescendingly
""Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white""
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you ""stay inside the lines""
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you ""stay inside the lines""
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for"
2002,43,Just Like a Pill,Pink,"I'm lying here on the floor
Where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here
What have you done?
I thought it would be fun

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get out of here

Where I can run
Just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

I haven't moved from the spot
Where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills
They were different
Maybe I should get some help

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

Every night, every day, just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay
Won't you lay
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head

There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
Set me free, feel the need in me, set me free

2002,46,Superman (It's Not Easy),Five for Fighting,"I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

I'm more than a bird
I'm more than a plane
More than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd
But don't be naïve
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed
But won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up, up and away, away from me
Well it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for Kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me
Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me

I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man looking for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy
It's not easy to be me"
2002,47,Cleanin' Out My Closet,Eminem,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said at the cost of her name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine
Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to
Rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moët for two

'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker, she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it (Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I oh, oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh yeah)
I'm not a man to play around baby (Ooh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat, for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When you're feeling all alone
All you gotta do, is just call me call me

Give me just a second and I'll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me till tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight

2002,63,Lose Yourself,Eminem,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone, when the party's over

I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self destruct

Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow

A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart

To make you come home, yeah
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange mhhmm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said to make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way,
To make it so that you were right here,
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone

Now, I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone no, no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeah...

Can't get you off my mind

See, I could never feel alone with you (in my life),
I'll give up everything I own for you (won't think twice),
Almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (such a shame),
I lose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why),
Because your kisses make my lips quiver (and that's real),
And when you touch me my whole body shivers (I can feel),
Now, I can see how another life (nother life),
Could have the power to take over mine... 'cause you're my...

2002,82,The Good Stuff,Kenny Chesney,"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
The corner bar
It just seemed right, so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end, an' lookin' half asleep
But he walked up and said ""What'll it be?""
I said, ""The good stuff""
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kinda went misty
He said, ""You can't find that here

'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin' so much
And it's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
An' eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff""

He grabbed a carton of milk 
And he poured a glass
Then I smiled and said
""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed""
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt sayin' 'I'm a grandpa'
Bein' right there as her time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff""

He said, ""When you get home she'll start to cry
When she says, 'I'm sorry,' say 'So am I'
Look into those eyes so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause thats the good stuff
That's the good stuff"""

2002,86,Drive (For Daddy Gene),Alan Jackson,"It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

When Daddy let me drive

Daddy let me drive

Oh he let me drive

It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson
And electric choke"

Do you want me

Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still

Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

Mothers on the stoop
Boys in souped-up coupes
On this hot summer night
Between fight and flight
Is the blind man's sight
And a choice that's right
I roll the window down
Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down

Do you need me

Then she called me up and hipped me to your steez
Told me that you were lookin' for a guy like me
So I said hold on, I ain't the one
Unless shorty really wanna have some fun
Then she said that you told her I was what you want
When I call you don't try to front (uh huh)

I'm the guy in your dreams (that you had last night)
I'm the benz wit tha 20'z (that you wanna drive)

Everybody knows about you and me
Ain't no more need for you and me to creep
I want you so bad I don't care who sees
So girl hold on, I got what you want
I know you ain't scared to go 'n' have some fun
So let your girlfriends know that you found someone
Who'll be keepin' you tight and sprung (uh huh)

I'm tha guy in your dreams (that you had last night)
I'm benz wit tha 20's (that you wanna drive)

Two months of conversation
Man it's a major
Split tha game undercover
I'm lethal like Danny Glover
Got you runnin' to your mother
Makin' plans for life
Yo, I'm only 15 what I need wit a wife?
We can walk through tha mall while I hold ya hips
Or you can hang out tha drop while I'm pushin' tha whip
Take you on a ride you will never forget
Runnin' home, tellin' your friends lil' Fizz is it
Got ya hooked by tha way that I lick my lips
And I got many dimes, I ain't sweatin' dis chick
Yo, I run these girls from coast to coast
Dropin' game so sick I got 'em doin' tha most (uh huh)"
2002,91,A New Day Has Come,Celine Dion,"A new day has come
A new day has come

I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

(Hush, love) I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched
By an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
(A new day has come)
(A new day has come)

Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

(Hush, love) I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched
By an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
(A new day has come)
(A new day has come)

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has come

Hush, love, I see a light in your eyes
I can't believe I've been touched
By an angel with love

I can't believe I've been touched
By an angel with love

Ohohoho

Hush now
I see a light in your eyes"
2002,92,Turn Off the Light,Nelly Furtado,"It's gettin' so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds
Or say woe is me instead
There's an achin' inside my head
It's tellin' me I'm better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see
If you will get some

They say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
Till you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I am good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see
Yeah, if you're gonna get some

They say that girl you know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
Till you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you, don't you, don't you, come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, wanna believe
I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Where is the love that I'm lookin' to find
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see
It's all in me, yeah

Where is your logic
Who do you need
Where can you turn in your delicate time of need

2002,93,Living and Living Well,George Strait,"Had a nice little life
A little boat, a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

'Til you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish, caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in livin'
I thought I was living
There's a difference in living and living well

Livin' well
I'm livin' well..."
2002,94,My List,Toby Keith,"Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my list of things to do today:
Go to the bank and the hardware store,
Put a new lock on the cellar door.
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done,
But when the sun is settled, there's still more than a few things left
I haven't got to yet.

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Wouldn't change the course of fate,
Cuttin' the grass just had to wait
'Cause I've got more important things
Like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow, what I could get done today

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Raise a little hell, laugh till it hurts,
Put an extra five in the plate at church,
Call up my folks just to chat,
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, and over sleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my List of things to do today."
2002,95,Hands Clean,Alanis Morissette,"If it weren't for your maturity none of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention you wouldn't have been successful and
If it weren't for me you would never have amounted to very much

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're kind of my protege and one day you'll say you learned all you know from me
I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would and I think I like it

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

Just make sure you don't tell on me especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world 'cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might want to marry you one day if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this"
2002,96,Sk8er Boi,Avril Lavigne,"He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rocking on MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

I'm with the skater boy
I said, ""See ya later, boy
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know""

2002,97,Long Time Gone,Dixie Chicks,"Daddy sits on the front porch swingin'
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley tobacco
Now he knows it never will
My brother found work in Indiana
Sister's a nurse at the old folks' home
Mama's still cooking too much for supper
And me, I been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin' back again

Deliah plays that old church piano
Sittin' out on her daddy's farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord, I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singing in the choir
Me I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord I been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
Lord I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin' back again

Now me, I went to Nashville
Trying to be the big deal
Playing down on Broadway
Getting there the hard way

Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I'm gonna be a star

Now me and Deliah
Singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
Listen to the radio to hear what's cooking
But the music ain't got no soul

Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think the rest is

A long time gone
No I ain't hit the roof since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back

I said a long time gone
No I ain't honked a horn since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

I said a long time, long time, long time gone

Whoa, it's been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone

Oh, it's been a long... time... gone
Long time, long time, long time gone"
2002,98,Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning),Alan Jackson,"Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell 
you the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?"
2002,99,Like I Love You,Justin Timberlake,"Just somethin' about you
The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me
Gettin' scared now, right
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right, listen

I kinda noticed something one night,
In the club a frump face,
It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so is datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Yeah
You know I could make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, hold my jacket

Ma' whatcha wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow'
Point to me I say 'Yeah, it's the same dough'
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night

(Malice)
Do a robbery, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
(I just love your... brain...)
Play number three, Joint called 'Brain'
Ma, take a hint
Make a swerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl...
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl...)

Ain't nobody love you like I love ya
(Can't love ya like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Makes me trust ya like I do, hey)
Late at night I talk to you (hey)
You will know the difference when I...

You know
I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way

It's kinda special right, yeah

Sometimes people are just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is

2002,100,I Do!!,Toya,"He was a 6 foot stallion say the storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpatatin' every time he came near
He had a spankin new Range sport a tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his hair was corn-rowed
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin out of control

Me and my crew started groovin made our way to the floor
It's time activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me I felt fingertips
On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin' hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this thug my man that I can tell you, for sure

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Now watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin' all the pappi's want me but all I want is you

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know

If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned

The way you do the things you do reminds me of my E Lexus Coup
That's why I'm all up in your grill tryna getcha to a hotel
You must be a football coach the way you got me playin' the field

So baby give me that (toot toot) and let me give ya that (beep beep)
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro bouncin' on 24's 
While they're sayin' on the radio

It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on Coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun

Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce
C'mon 

It's like ""Murder She Wrote"" once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door still they can hear ya screamin' more 
Girl I'm feeling what you're feelin' no more hopin' and wishin' 
I'm about to take my key and stick it in the ignition 

So baby give me that (toot toot) and let me give ya that (beep beep)
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro bouncin' on 24's 
While they're sayin' on the radio

It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on Coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun

Cristal poppin' in the stretch Navigator 
They got food everywhere as if the party was catered 
I got fellas to my left and honeys to my right
We bring them both together and we got jukin' all night 
Then after the show it's the after party (yeah) 
And after the party it's the hotel lobby (yeah)
And around about 4 you gotta clear the lobby
Then take it to your room and somebody 

Can I get a (toot toot) can I get a (beep beep)
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro bouncin' on 24's 
While they're sayin' on the radio

That you may never see
There's secrets in this life
That I can't hide

Well, somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well, maybe it's too far away
Or maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

When your education x-ray
Cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing
That I could not tell my friends

Now roaming through this darkness
I'm alive but I'm alone
Part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am

Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

Friends with shadows on my wall

Breakdown

But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Me
Talking to myself in public
And dodging glances on the train

And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be something wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down

Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today

So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone, left the puzzle undone
Ain't that the way it is?

'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no, no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (Yeaheah, yeaheah!)
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine!)
And tomorrow we might awake on the other side

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

You can do anything you set your mind to, man."

And found in time she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true

When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to Miss No Longer Afraid?

It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""Why can't that be me?""
I'm so glad I finally see

What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love, when love is true

2003,45,Calling All Angels,Train,"I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake from the words that I said

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

And I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

When children have to play inside so they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies 'cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens and losing sight of having dreams
In a world where all we want is only what we want until it's ours

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
And I'm calling all angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
And I'm calling all you angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels

I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait
When a moment can vanish so fast
'Cause every kiss
Is a kiss you can never get back

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

When the answer to all my dreams
Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here
Holding back what I'm trying to say

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right

Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

This is the night where we capture forever
And all our tomorrows begin
After tonight
We will never be lonely again

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right

Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly

One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland

Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling
Towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust,
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothin' comes easy it takes much practice,
Like I met a woman who was becoming a star,
She was very beautiful leaving people in awe.
Singin' songs, later on, but the younger version,
Hung wit' the wrong person, got her stunger than heroine,
Cocaine, sniffin' up drugs all in her nose,
Could've died so young, now looks ugly and old,
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death,
Watch the company you keep, and the crowd you bring,
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing,
So if you gonna be the best I'm'a tell you how,
Put your hands in the air and take the vow

This is for grown looking girls who's only ten.
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the clubs with fake ID.
Careful 'fore you meet a man with HIV.
You can host a TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow,
You're thinking he can give you wealth but so
Young boy, you could use a lot of help you know
Ya thinkin' life's all about smokin' weed and ice.
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write,
Beggin' different women for a place to sleep at night.
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish.
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)

B, be'fore we came to this country,
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.
There was empires in Africa called Kush,
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold; When
Gold was converted to money it all changed,
Money then became empowerment for Europeans.
The Persian military invaded,
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked,
Slavery was money, so they began making slaveships.
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was in shock that in the mountains were black faces.
Shot off their nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today you see.
If the truth is told the youth can grow.
They'll learn to survive, until they gain control.
Nobody says you have to be gangsters, hoes.
Read more, learn more, change the globe.
Ghetto children do your thing.
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king.
Young princess when you get your wedding ring,
Your man is saying, ""She's my queen!""

I know I can (I know I can)

2003,62,Here Without You,3 Doors Down,"A hundred days to make me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same

And all the miles that separate
You disappeared and I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave and wave to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go

Oho, yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me

Everything I know
And anywhere I go
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

And when the last one falls
When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby

They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime

2003,69,Angel,Amanda Perez,"It's been five months
Since you went away
Left without a word,
Nothing to say (nothin' to say)
When I was the one,
Who gave you my heart and soul,
But it wasn't good enough for you
No... Oh oh oh oh
So I asked God


God send me an Angel
From the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart,
From being in love,
'Cause all I dooo... is cry (is cry)
God send me an Angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

And I know it might sound crazy,
But after all that I still loved you.
You wanna come back in my life,
But now there's something I have to do.
I have to tell the one that I once adored,
That they can't have my love no more,
My heart can't take no more lies,
And my eyes are all out of cries
So... God

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please
To send you back to me
I couldn't eat
I couldn't sleep
You even made me feel like I could not breathe
When I... all I wanted to do
Was feel your touch
And to give you all of my love
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now
But you can't have it
Oh God!

Oh God!

Send me an Angel (send me an angel)
An Angel!
Wipe the tears from my eyes
God send me an Angel from the Heavens above
Sent me an Angel (to heal my broken heart)
God send me an Angel
From being in love
Send me (an Angel)
Oh God!
Send me an Angel
Send me (an Angel)
(An Angel)"
2003,70,She Hates Me,Puddle of Mudd,"Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who would slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt, not feeling pain, no

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

That's my story, as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it's over and I'm glad
'Cause I'm a fool for all I've said

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love
Trust
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la love

I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it... four years down the drain
Oh how I wish things would of happened so differently
I try'd to save us so many times but still you couldn't see
U kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again
And now you tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
And ur tryin' to come back home
Ur tellin' me you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
But baby i

Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
U keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight and say the things
That hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try don't wanna try I 'bout just had enough it's been a rough road
Baby just let it go
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

U and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up face reality
It all just seem to good to be true after all you put me through
And now you tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
And you tryin' to come back home
U tellin' me that you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor

You think I'd despise you
But in the end I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
I guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up, 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joyride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But, oh, oh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Oho, oho
Oho, oho
Ohohoho, yeaheaheah
Aha

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game

I heard you're going around
Playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hurt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, aha, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies
Disguise yourself through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gonna stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Thought I would forget
But I, I remember, ohohohoho
Yes, I remember, ohoho

Thought I would forget, ooohooohooo

Yes, I remember, ohoho!

2003,80,Thugz Mansion,2Pac,"Tupac:
Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion

Tupac:
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would have tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'

(Chorus: Anthony Hamilton)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the sky...
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the sky...

2Pac:
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion


2Pac:
Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, till the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'"
2003,81,Clocks,Coldplay,"The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are
You are
You are
You are

You are
You are

And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)"

I don't wanna fuel this fire no more, no more, no more
See, I made up my mind 'cause I've wasted my time
Ain't nothin' here to keep me warm

2003,84,19 Somethin',Mark Wills,"I saw Star Wars at least 8 times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside,
Stretch Armstrong
Yeah

I was Roger Staubach back in my back yard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evil Kinevil scars
On my right arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried

It was 1970-something
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Faucett hair-do days
Bell bottoms and 8-track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1970-something

It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
Dad broke down and finally shaved
Them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubix cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A Space Shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1980-something

Now I got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish sometimes
Sometimes...

2003,85,"Can't Stop, Won't Stop",Young Gunz,NaN
2003,86,Red Dirt Road,Brooks & Dunn,"I was raised off of rural route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
And race barefoot back to Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned the corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

Her daddy didn't like me much
In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
And drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
It feels like I found a long lost friend

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road."
2003,87,What Was I Thinkin',Dierks Bentley,"Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?

She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinkin'?

Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'?

I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'

Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... 'cause I was

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'"
2003,88,Flying Without Wings,Ruben Studdard,"Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You have found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

But for me, it's waking up beside you, yeah
To watch the sun rise on your face
To know that I can say ""I love you""
At any given time or place

It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine, all mine
And it's the flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

You're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy it brings
I'm flying without wings"
2003,89,Sing for the Moment,Eminem,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Chorus from Aerosmith's Dream On)
(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus

But music is reflection of self, we just explain it
And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away"
2003,90,Have You Forgotten?,Darryl Worley,"I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start your preaching let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away


Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost and those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry about bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?"

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand, with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems

Want a towel or a chair, in the sand by the sea
Wanna look through my shades, and see you there with me
Wanna soak up life for awhile, and lay back low
No boss no clock no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues, hey I forgot 'em

What's goin' on? Yeah I know I'm wrong
For goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'
Hopin' ya ""Home Alone"" like Caulkin
But I picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected

I'm so sick of bein' lon-
Ah, don't finish yo statement
You alone call me, I'll be yo replacement
Put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go
Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
'Cause ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a plate of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
'Cause I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'
Something so pretty as you at home alone
That's unbelieveable, like when the cow jumped over the moon
Now, I never put nothin' before you

2003,97,Don't Know Why,Norah Jones,"I waited till I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come, I
Don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come, I
Don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come"

You want me to tell you somethin'? (Uh huh)
I know what you wanna hear



'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you, too
(I think I love you baby)
I think I love you, too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you, too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy)
Bitch, you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down

In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face

I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass

Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, copin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Am I too nice to buy you ice?
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be my new wife?
What you Mariah, fly through twice?

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman

I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what
That's about as far as your buddy goes

We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then

You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie

But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

You're just plain old Marshall to me)

Ooh yeah girl run that game
(Haily Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot in Pieces"", uhh that's great)

First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool

There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy-wody you must be
Gone off that quarter bottle

You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands

Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Cept to do the best I can
I'll be damned
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may be a real bad boy
Oh but baby I'm a real good man
Yes I am"

And it's better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you

Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again 
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me

To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears

3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man son of a bitch
Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Goose and orange juice man this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club on the set Kwon cut out them trees
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P.

Now everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

2004,12,Confessions Part II,Usher,"Watch this...

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my

Confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so thrown, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it

The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my

Confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with

I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said one second baby, please hear me

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my

Confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta keep part two of my

Confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions"

2004,15,Here Without You,3 Doors Down,"A hundred days to make me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same

And all the miles that separate
You disappeared and I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave and wave to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go

Oho, yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me

Everything I know
And anywhere I go
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

And when the last one falls
When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

That we could end up saying 
Things we've always needed to say 
So we could end up staying

2004,19,My Immortal,Evanescence,"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Me

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy who told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin' my balls
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin', off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back nigga' 'cause I'm straight with the Roc

But like, fifty-two cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

If you feelin' like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off

Me and my beautiful Bey-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, nigga's scared of that black
I drop that +Black, Album+ then I back, out it

Line it up till you spoiled
And have them other chicks throwin', vomit it up

I can't believe I fell for your schemes I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man

It took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me, Myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I will be my own best friend

So controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know

I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day
You know, cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean, we could just go across the street to the ark right here
Wait, hold up, my, my cell phone breaking up, hold up

Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at 106 and Park

Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly; afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it, where's the sense in that?

Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble, I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of ""it's over""
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet, which I'm sure we will
All that was there will be there still
I'll let it pass and hold my tongue
And you will think that I've moved on

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender

Or here to convert atheists into believers

The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about

Now that I'm with you

And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke

I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me

We on fire
Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire

Naw I ain't puttin' nuttin' out, I smoke when I wanna
26 inch chrome spokes on a Hummer
This heat gon' last for the whole summer
Runnin' your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buyin diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin is your hair
Yeah, I'm ridin' with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists gettin' wrong deals
I'm only 21, sittin' on mill's

If I 'ont hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm tryna play, you tryna have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care 'bout what the next nigga bought her
'Cause I ain't puttin' no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend' quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't biast when I'm ridin' through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater

Bitch say somethin', I ain't a mind reader

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady

Becky, oh my fuckin' God, it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God, dude, you fuckin' rock
Please won't you please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my A Capella's
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Because I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

Eminem: Ah, dude?

Swifty:
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
Hey dad how come we don't rap off Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no, I'm Swift (""Oh, I thought you was Kuniva"")
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room?
Cause our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, (uh-huh) it's simple but,
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back

Kuniva and Kon Artis:
Kuniva: Look at Em, little punk ass, thinkin' he the shit
Kon: Yeah, I know, man, by himself takin' on a flick
Kuniva: Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
Eminem: No I had an interview, not you two
Kuniva: You gonna be late for sound check
Kon: Man I ain't goin' to sound check
Kuniva: Man our mics are screwed up
Kon: And his always sound best.. You know what man I'ma say somethin'
Kuniva: Hey yo, Em
Eminem: You got somethin' to say
Kon: Man, nothin'
Kuniva: I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man, what's up
Kon: Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it man shut up. And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
Kuniva: Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Kon: Man, whatever
Kuniva: I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band,
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands,
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man,
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

Proof:
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Hey yo, what's....)
Ready to snap on a dumb ass fan
Every time I hear
""Hey dude, I love your band""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys actin' funny every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag)
Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(""Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!"")

Bizarre:
God dammit, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
""But what about Eminem?""
Bitch, are you retarded
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute
""Hey sexy""
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up (Uhh!)
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout start a group with the real Roxanne

Eminem:
Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

Man, fuck this
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (ha ha)
But they all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer...

Eminem:
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa (wooo ohhh), look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants

It's dat real
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in dept
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if there part of your set
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yeah, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin' down
Why they sellin' niggaz CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my niggaz ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill Tupac 'n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why

(Chorus: Anthony Hamilton)
All that I been givin'
Is this thing that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why, oh why
Why they do me like that

Why would niggaz push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggaz get degreez in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggaz lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggaz can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least

(Jadakiss)
Uh, yeah, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, 'cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a why lie I need a beer sign
Why all the young niggaz is dyin'
'Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
'Cause I got all my old ones

Have you always been inside waiting to breathe

Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away

I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away

I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change

2004,79,Breaking the Habit,Linkin Park,"Memories consume like opening the wounds
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way; I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight"

2004,81,Live Like You Were Dying,Tim McGraw,"He said, ""I was in my early 40s
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the X-rays
And talking 'bout the options, and talking 'bout
Sweet time
I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man, what'd ya do""
And he said

""I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying""
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

He said, ""I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well, I, I finally read the Good Book
And I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then

I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named
Fumanchu,
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying""
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

Like, tomorrow was a gift
And you got eternity to think about what'd you do
With it
What did you do with it?
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?

Skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named
Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""
Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'"
2004,82,Remember When,Alan Jackson,"Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still, and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried, remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt, remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each others hearts, remember when

Remember when, the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up, remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now, lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again, remember when

Remember when we said, when we turn gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had 
And we'll remember when

Remember when
Remember when"
2004,83,Everytime,Britney Spears,"Notice me, take my hand 
Why are we strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 

Every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done? 
You seem to move on easy 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 

At night, I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby"

Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone
Up and at 'em bright and early

Yeah, I'm dressed for success
From my head down to my boots

I don't do it for money
There's bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory
I just do it anyway
Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah I'm real good under pressure
Being all that I can be

And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekend's been too strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long
You can bet that I stand ready
When the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady
Hey I'm true down to the core

And I will always do my duty
No matter what the price
I've counted up the cost
I know the sacrifice
Oh, and I don't want to die for you
But if dyin's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
'Cause freedom don't come free

I'm an American soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters
I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy
I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines
Sleep in peace tonight

He is to the east coast what Snoop is,
To the west coast what Face is to Houston

No bra with the blouse it's so necessary
No panties and jeans that's so necessary

You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?
The one who gives it all away, yeah

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah

Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm
Is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants
I'll have to kick your ass
And make you never forget

I'm gonna ask to you stop
Thought I liked you a lot but I'm really upset
(Really upset)
Get out of my head, get off of my bed
Yeah, that's what I said

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?

Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say

2004,93,You'll Think of Me,Keith Urban,"I woke up early this morning around 4a.m.
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's okay, there's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.

I went out driving, trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been.
So

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me.

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life.

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me.

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather

But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.

2004,97,Redneck Woman,Gretchen Wilson,"Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet champagne, I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern, or in a honky tonk, or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid, and Strait
Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip

'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So, here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah

Victoria's Secret, well their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price
And still look sexy, just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me
Well, you might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door

Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah

I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hhell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
I said hell yeah"
2004,98,Just Lose It,Eminem,"Okay!

Guess who's back (back, back)
Back again ( 'gain, 'gain)
Shady's back (back, back)
Tell a friend (friend, friend)

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright stop - pajama time 

Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean wrap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation

Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
Having touched on everything but little boys

An' that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes

Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like tee pee for my bunghole and it's cool if you let one go

Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it
Give a little poot poot, it's okay (*fart*)
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
Get your chance, yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Just lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Go crazy (aah aah aah aah aah)
Oh baby (aah aah) Oh baby(aah aah) 

It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday 
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Every day's just a holiday

Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body

'Scuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...there

What's your name girl, what's your sign
Dr. Dre: Man, you must be up out your mind
Eminem: Dre, aah aah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Just lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Go crazy (aah aah aah aah aah)
Oh baby (aah aah) Oh baby(aah aah) 

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming (aah aah aah aah aah)

Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
Boy we got you on tape
Yelling at an old lady, 
""Touch my body.""

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real intense no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 

A step back to reality 
Look it's B. Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle
I'm a grown man 
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba 
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Tubba Teletubbie

Fellas (What?) fellas (What?) 
Grab your left nut, make the right one jealous (What?) 
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls 
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls

Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romance or 
Butt squeezin', it's the season 
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasing 

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Just lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Go crazy (aah aah aah aah aah)
Oh baby (aah aah) Oh baby(aah aah) 

Mmmmm touch my body 
Mmmmm touch my body 
Ooh boy just touch my body 
I mean girl just touch my body"
2004,99,Letters from Home,John Michael Montgomery,"My Dearest Son, it's almost June
I hope this letter Catches up with you and finds you well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol' in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said to much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared in our boots
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's womething funny
'Bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best y'all
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night Long,
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring
Man on the Television said
Something So I couldn't sleep
But iIll be all right, I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh 'cause she calls me honey
But they take it hard, 'cause I don't read the good parts
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me Drivin' on, waitn' on
Letters from home

Dear son, I know I ain't written
And sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me I might not have said it, so I'll say it now
Son, You make me proud

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs 'cause ain't nothin'
Funny when a soldier cries, and I just wipe my eyes
I fold it up and put in my shirt get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on,
Letters from home"
2004,100,I Go Back,Kenny Chesney,"'Jack and Diane' painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-ton short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

Well, I used to rock all night long
To 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back
(I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back
I go back"
2005,1,We Belong Together,Mariah Carey,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, oh
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should've held on tight, I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sittin' here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything, I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling, now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here 'cause, baby
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio, singing to me
""If you think you're lonely now.""
Wait a minute, this is too deep 
I gotta change the station 
So I turn the dial, trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back, baby, please 
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? 
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together"

The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk-a

My shadow's only one who walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk-a

My shadow's only one who walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

Heard y'all was

Hold up my phone's breakin' up
Imma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind

Save this recording because

So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

When my heart still on the mend
Open up to me

And you sing to me

And it's harmony

Make me say anything
Just to get you back again
Why can't we just try

What if I was good to you?
What if you were good to me?
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me?

And what if it was paradise?
And what if we were symphonies?
What if I gave all my life
To find some way to stand beside you?

And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But, when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassion's in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
You should have never come around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand

Go fix yourself!

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own life

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own life

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're damned as free

You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss because I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Lining them up like ass cracks
Lay these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack

Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care Bear reppin' in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahaa

Yo, we goin' ghost town, this Motown
With yo sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo sound, you kill the Inc.

2005,38,Let Me Go,3 Doors Down,"One more kiss could be the best thing
Or one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve

In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

And you love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go, let me go

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on lovin' you
How can this love be a good thing
And I know what I'm going through

In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

And you love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go, just let me go, let me go

And no matter how hard I try
I can't escape these things inside
I know, I know
But all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows, who knows

You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go, just let me go

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name

Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side

Can I get another amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

(Hey!)

(Three four)

The representative from California has the floor...

""Zieg Heil"" to the president gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel Towers
Who criticize your government

Bang bang, goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me

Just 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah!

2005,43,Photograph,Nickelback,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
It's time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every time I do it makes me"

Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord
That's always been there
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride

Backtracking over these few years
Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through 
You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl 
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run 
And I would be out chasing you

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see 
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out baby)
I had never wished to ever hurt my baby (hurt my baby)
And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so...

A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find, you and I collide

I'm quiet, you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find, you and I collide

Don't stop here
I've lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find, you and I collide

You finally find 
You and I collide
You finally find

But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

A butterfly tattoo
Right above your naval
Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl
Come take a walk with me
You'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you
It's over-rollin' with you yeah

To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
And we all can use shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you

Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand
I'll start before I can stop
Or before I see things the right way up

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Or Japan and China all lit up
A sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I could've seen
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand"
2005,58,I Don't Want to Be,Gavin DeGraw,"I don't need to be anything other
Than a prison guard's son
I don't need to be anything other
Than a specialist's son

I don't have to be anyone other
Than the birth of two souls in one
Part of where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm coming from

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind

I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me

I'm surrounded by liars
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by imposters
Everywhere I turn

I'm surrounded by identity crisis
Everywhere I turn
Am I the only one who noticed?
I can't be the only one who's learned

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind

I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me

Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave
I came from the mountain
The crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody

I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms

Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me
I don't want to be"
2005,59,Mockingbird,Eminem,"Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)"

He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times 
But somehow, I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full, and my door's always open
You come anytime you want, yeah

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved 
And she will be loved

I know where you hide, alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

I don't mind spending everyday

Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me, I can't find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you, all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you, all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go (Alone, oh)

I've tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep

Anotha nigga got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
Da king back now hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club stippers gettin' naked 'fore I sat down
Still ballin money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin' shows puttin' my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town

Aye, all my hotgirls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

If I hit you in the face you gon be suin and shit
And if I catch anotha case I know I'm true to be missed
So I'ma keep it cool head stay out of the news
Headlines and shows other rappers its bedtime (bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrerra to shine

Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?

Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

I need to be your lady

That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby

Break it down now I'll tell you what I feel

My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me
And you love me I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you I'll put it down be the woman for you

I guess it's right
It's so amazing
Everytime I see you, I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone

Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
(I wanna be inside your heaven)

When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to that place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Ever bit of air you're breathin', a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven"
2005,72,Because of You,Kelly Clarkson,"Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you"
2005,73,Truth Is,Fantasia,"Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face from a chapter in my past
Talked for awhile, asked him how he's been
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself


(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is it hurts
But I know that the fault's mine
'Cause I let him go
Tried to get over it, but it's messing with my mind (because I know)

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) But when it's all said and done, guess I'm still in love with you

I just gotta be honest, I guess
I-I guess I'm still in love, in love, in love"

Hotter than a bisquick biscuit out the oven

Park outside minglin wit' my homeboys
Faked out fake hugs leave me alone boy
Plus the candy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls actin' cross the street
But on the other hand
Alfalfa Just hit me on my metro
Say a party in the park hard baby let's go

Smooth like Shaft come here girl

Now I found the love of my life
Passes things, get more comfortable
Everything is going right

And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that 
You and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through

I know we're cool
I know we're cool

We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown, oh
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through

I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool

And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been

I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily

Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keates
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm havin' trouble sayin' what I mean
With dead poets and a drum machine

Now you're gonna raise the bar right up

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to you
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

Tryna maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too"

You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face... I said girls...

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
If you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots, got in a tight spot
Hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big fat biker man
I heard David yell across the room
Hey buddy, how 'bout a helpin' hand... I said Dave...

I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
If you want to fight tonight
Guess them boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says you can't do this boy
But my pride says oh yes you can...

I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feelin' bullet proof
So don't double-dog dare me now
'Cause I might have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was"

To put it on me deep in the right direction

Ho, oh

Girl, I`m in love with you
This ain`t the honeymoon
We're past the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day

I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, ho
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, ho
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion, y'all
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way, huh

I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy, I still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, ho, oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh, oh, ha

Take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Maybe you'll never find
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow, we'll never know

But she knows what she's doing
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

She can't keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on 100 proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me, the more I adore her
What can I do?
I'd do anything for her

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more

The way she sees it's me
On her caller I.D.
She won't pick up the phone
She'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
'Cause every word she's ever said
Is still ringing in my head
Still ringing in my head

She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doing
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else

Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 80 4's come rollin' up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my bar now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
2 8 1, 3 3 0, eight zero zero fo'
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow

I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin' pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
2 slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller
She would want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryin' to call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' ho ass like you dogged me

Befo' my paper came, befo' I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin' on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name start blowin' up quick, now they jumpin' on my dick
'Cause they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin' up quick, now they jumpin' on my dick

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down, upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud

Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the Earth
The Sun was just yellow energy

There is a living promise land
And even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind, and cover me
Bringing back, more than a memory

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down, upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your strength...

You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over, the sides...

That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways

Some would rather run down and get one cow (nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout right? Look

I'm never going nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me
Respected highly, HIIII MR. O'REILLY
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of my Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded rapping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell them holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later until these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin' so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
'Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards

They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""

Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo

Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

(A holiday)
You had a bad day
(A holiday)
You had a bad day

You had a bad day"

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

2006,7,Crazy,Gnarls Barkley,"I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mmm

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice, mmm

Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them

Mmm, ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"

But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)

Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)

I'll be faithful (yes)

This ain't for you (no, this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true (come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (hands up)

2006,13,Over My Head (Cable Car),The Fray,"I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth

But that's how it's got to be
It's comin' down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along

But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the arguments in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on, oh

And suddenly, I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless

Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground in the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...

Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie

Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?

Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, whatcha gonna?""

Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

She's a lover, baby, and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a-gunnin' for the quota

Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last

2006,26,What Hurts the Most,Rascal Flatts,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder: getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been

2006,27,How to Save a Life,The Fray,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life

2006,28,Unfaithful,Rihanna,"Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah"

How I feel

Are said too much
They're not enough

Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

Just know that these things will never change for us at all

Honey, why you crying? Is everything okay?

Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes, I dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me?
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think he has a clue

And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch I feel this static
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so, I can't let you go
Want you in my life

The good and the bad times, we've been through them all

Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor

Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor

Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it

Goodbye, goodbye

Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Always dancin' next to me

Do do do do do
Yeah

Yo,
Tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick
That a young'n
Never seen before

I said Yo,
Tell her girls I want to meet her (meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I got to give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it
There she is I got to stop her

Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time
She's out the door
I got to go for mine

I think I'll say

Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby

Now shorty grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the flow is ours
You say you don't really dance

Don't worry about it
We'll just one, two, step
One, two, step

Now if the music is moving too fast
Grab my hand a little tighter
Don't be afraid to move a little closer

Girl, there is something about you that makes me want to say

Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby

Breakdown
I want to be where you are,
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing.

Baby it's so romantic.

Baby I can be in your heart.

So many things I want to tell you,
I think that I should start by saying ""Yo.""

I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

I got to give her game proper,
Ppit it so she get it,
There she is - I got to stop her.

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby.

spoken:
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (like this),
Just clap your hands like this (whooo like this).

And if your shorty is in the house tonight,
Just grab her by the hand homie,
Make her understand y'all was made to dance like this (like this).

Y'all was made to bounce like this (whoa like this).

Just let her know she was made for you,
And you want to do everything she want to man.

Laughs

You need to know
The situations getting old
And now the more you talk the less I can take, oh

Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?

And never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (alone)

Live and breathe for me
Do you care for me

(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

I felt a little fear, upon my back
I said, ""Don't look back, just keep on walking.""
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
When the big black horse said, ""Look this way.""
He said, ""Hey lady, will you marry me?""
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

But I said, ""No, no. No, no-no-no.
""No, no. You're not the one for me.
""No, no. No, no-no-no.
""No, no. You're not the one for me.""

(Ooh, woo-hoo)

No, no, no, no.

And my heart had a problem, in the early hours,
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that,
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Now It won't come back, 'cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

And It said, ""No, no, no, no-no-no.
""No, no, you're not the one for me.
""No, no, no, no-no-no.
""No, no, you're not the one for me.""

(Ooh, woo-hoo) (not the one for me, yeah-eh)
(Ooh, woo-hoo)
Said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no
You're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no
You're not the one for me

2006,67,One Wish,Ray J,"Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes 'cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time"

Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thongs

Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her ""get another round""
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground
Fresh force ones, Sean John button down

2006,76,Life Is a Highway,Rascal Flatts,"Hoo!
Mmm yeah

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside ev'ry darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood
I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
Whooo
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)

Ah gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
Umm yeah
If you're going my way (you're going my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye

Ooooo...Yeah!

There ain't no load that I can't hold
A road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (all night long)
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Ah gimme gimme gimme, ah gimme gimme yeah

Life is a highway (life is a highway)

2006,77,Call Me When You're Sober,Evanescence,"Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

Should I let you fall and lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late

Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

Couldn't take the blame
Sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated
No wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over
It's over

How could I have burned paradise?
How could I? You were never mine

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me
Just get your things
I've made up your mind"
2006,78,"Jesus, Take the Wheel",Carrie Underwood,"She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on""

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me"

2006,82,Hate Me,Blue October,"
If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me

Mother:
Hi, Justin, this is your mother.
It's 2:33 on Monday afternoon.
I was just calling to see how you were doing, you sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous, too.
I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too.
You know I love ya!
Take care, honey, I know you're under a lot of pressure.
See ya.
Bye, bye!

I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away""
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?""

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

For you
For you
For you

If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me

Dang, I know, I know
But it's just 
There's some things I got to get off my chest alright

Yeah

Baby, come in, sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say, so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been 
No walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I'm finished, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

How do you let it go? When you
You just don't know? What's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand
'Cause I know

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go 
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I
Found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world, and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart, and I wanna know

How do you let it go? When you
You just don't know? What's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand
What I'm tryin'a say
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along
Girl how you not gonna see it?

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you

But we know that we gotta go

And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it
I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry

Do you hear me crying?
There's never a right time

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me 
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
(About you and me)
There's never a right time to say goodbye
(Oh, no, it ain't)
But we know that we gotta go
(Go) 
Our separate ways

And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me

2006,87,Waiting on the World to Change,John Mayer,"Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door

And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change"

2006,90,When I'm Gone,Eminem,"Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?""
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back"

2006,93,Love,Keyshia Cole,"I used to think that I wasn't fun enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games, what's this all about
And I can't believe,
You're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her
You ain't see in me
But I guess it was all just make-believe

Oh, Love
Never knew what I was missing
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found...
Love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found...

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do
I'm so empty
My heart, my soul can't go on
Go on without you...
My rainy days fade away, when you
Come around please tell me baby
Why you go so far away
Why you go...

Love...
Never knew what I was missing
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found...

I found you
Yeah

Now you go, what am I gonna do
I'm so empty

Go on baby without you...
Rainy days fade away
When you come around
Say your here to stay
With me boy
I don't want you to leave me
I need you...

2006,94,When You're Mad,Ne-Yo,"It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing (fussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up

I don't mean no disrespect 
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you mad
I'm sorry that seeing you mad is so sexy

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place?
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around 
That makes me wanna tear you down?
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy
When you're mad

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better 
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place?
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around 
That makes me wanna tear you down?
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you

2006,96,Stupid Girls,Pink,"Stupid girl, stupid girls, stupid girl
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughing loud so all the little people stare
Looking for a daddy to pay for the champagne
(Drop a name)
What happened to the dreams of a girl president
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Break it down now)
The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take any more
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see
Disaster's all around
A world of despair
My only concern:
Will it fuck up my hair!

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Do ya thing, do ya thing, do ya thing)
(I like this, like this, like this)
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair I'll suck it girl, stupid girl!
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair I'll suck it girl, stupid girl! 

Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, stupid girl!

Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl"

You won't get out the county, 'cause you're damned as free

You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss because I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land

Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

2006,99,Do I Make You Proud,Taylor Hicks,"I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall

My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know

I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)
But do I make you proud?

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud?
But do I make you proud?

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud"
2006,100,For You I Will (Confidence),Teddy Geiger,"Wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have

Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel about you

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will

Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
'Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes like a water bed

Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I want to be exposed and not be afraid to fall

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you

If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a mood, yeah I would
Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah

That's what I'd do
That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

If I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (don't touch)

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me

Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

Call up that chick and see if she's home

What did you think I was putting you out for?

Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you

And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now she's probably up singing
Some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

Oh, that I dug my key into the side

We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away

I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way

Delilah I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history

Like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me"

I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Snoop Dog
Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, hoe sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say: ""I don't talk, Dogg, unless you told on me"", oh well

Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do
Baby, stick to me and I'mma stick on you
If you pick me then I'mma pick on you
D-o-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you

I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot 'fore the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and baby you're pussy for life

Shorty I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
See you lookin' at me now what it's gon' be
Just another tease far as I can see

Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub

And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala use to move 'phetamines
Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl

Snoop Dog
Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (just smokin')
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (baby I see you), mmm

It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

Akon
Girl, and while you're looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary

'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Lil' mully don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole

The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry

It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid

I want to dive into you
Forget what we're going through
I get behind, you make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

I have no alibi

You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why

This is why I'm hot, I don't gotta rap
I can sell a mil' sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say we lost it, so I'mma bring it back

I love the dirty dirty, 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit that shit I watch 'em get it on the floor

And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it any day
Compton to Hollywood as soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in that low-low, I do it the Cali way

And when I hit the Chi', people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my, my attire
They love how I move crowds from side to side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply

16 bars, 24 a pop
44 songs, nigga gimme what you got

I'm into drivin' cars, push 'em off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down just so I can shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me what you need, you know I get 'em by the flock

I call my homie Black, meet me on the ave
I hit Wash Heights with the money in the bag
We into big spinners, see my pimpin' never dragged
Find me wit' different women that you niggas never had

For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between, you'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so clean, the way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot my nigga this is what I mean

Ask me what I paid and I say, ""Yeah, I paid a guap.""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop

They hop in the car, I tell them, ""All aboard!""
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em, man, they tell me that's they song

They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck and compliments the arm 
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare

Then niggas start to hate, tearrange their face
But little do they know I keep them things by waist-side
I reply: Nobody gotta die
Similar to Li'l Weezy 'cause I got that fire

Thought it was me and you, baby

But I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Yo, yo
Let me paint this picture for you baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone

I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt

Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
You'll see

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)

2007,24,How to Save a Life,The Fray,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

I'm goin' to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain

Well I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, well I'm going home

The miles are getting longer it seems, the closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true and I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try

So I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all and then some you don't want
Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all

And you can't see my eyes unless my head is bent, you dig?

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Ya boy gettin' paper (Money), I buy big cars (Foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (Choose one)
Stay sky high (Twisted), Fly wit the stars (Twinkle, Twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (Ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missing (Flossin')
I'm sitting clean with the bottom kitted (do it)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistening (Ballin'!)
But I spent bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doing the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screaming ""fuck the cops""

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (One chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (Speeding)
100 g's worth of ice on the audermar? (Flossy)
And we in the street life until they call the law (Ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (What happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet (Got em)
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 a.m.: we was at the club (What happened?)
2 a.m.: 10 bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)
And about 3-something I was thinking about grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (Twisted)

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)

Nigga, could you buy that?
I keep 20 in the pocket (Light Change)
Talk a buck 80 If the bentley is the topic (That Grey Poupon)
But of course gotta fly ...? (Where?)
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (Get Your Money Up)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got an urge (Speeding)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous living in the fast lane (Ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'mma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (Let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

2007,36,Rockstar,Nickelback,"I'm through with standing in line to clubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

(Mmm so what you need)

I'll need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

(So how ya gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there

Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
And we'll, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

(I'll have the quesadilla, on the house)

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

(So how ya gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's ""Who's Who""
They'll get you anything, with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial
Well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

'Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

For what I've done, I'll start again and whatever pain may come
Today this ends, I'm forgiving what I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

Now I'm missing you and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Why did you have to go?
You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone

Girl you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand
And all my tears they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So baby I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away
(When) Everything stays the same
I just can't do it baby

What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what it is and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me?
You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby why can't we just start all over again
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So baby I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true

It's kind of hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying? Is everything okay?
I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes, I dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me?
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think he has a clue

Oh well, my girl's in the next room

We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door

And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change"

You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me

I give the final blow

When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

A falling star, at least I fall alone 
I can't explain what you can't explain 
You're finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain

It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight

Now I'm on my own side 
It's better than being on your side 
It's my fault when you're blind 
It's better that I see it through your eyes 

All these thoughts locked inside 
Now you're the first to know 

When darkness turns to light 
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

Just a little insight won't make this right 
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight
It ends when darkness turns to light 
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

Just a little insight won't make this right 
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight
Tonight, insight 
When darkness turns to light it ends tonight"

I want it when I don't
Tell myself I stop every day

I can barely move

And it's all because of you

All because of you

All because of you
And it's all because of you

Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I'm gon get me some
Know I should stay away from
'Cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even If I did I don't know If I would quit but I doubt it

2007,59,Welcome to the Black Parade,My Chemical Romance,"When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it, the anthem won't explain it

And while that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me, 'cause I cannot care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all (We'll carry on)
We wanna play this part

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world (We'll carry on)
Will never take my heart
Go and try (We'll carry)
You'll never break me

We wanna play this part"

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Just know that these things will never change for us at all

Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said no, no, no
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

The man said, ""Why you think you're here""
I said, ""I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near""
He said, ""I just think you're depressed""
This me, ""Yeah, baby, and the rest""

They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said no, no, no
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend
And it's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said no, no, no
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go"

Do it for my daughters and my youngest son's mama who

Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you

There ain't no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you"

All our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye
But we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
And we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

All of the wasted time
The hours that were left behind
The answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing tonight

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
But we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn

Yeah.

This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much.

They like the way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape.

She's crazy, right?

They like the way we react every time we hear the...
Every time the bass bang

You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare.

See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go...

Every time the bass bang
Realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart

When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more, time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside

Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside

Listen what I say oh
Come back and hey oh
Look at what I say oh

Where it's so white as snow

By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

When to descend, to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out

Step from the road to the sea to the sky

Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, oh yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh yeah"

Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait

Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know
You know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long

I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand

I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know
You know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long

I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you

I have loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing

'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing

'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go

Hold on to me and never let me go"

She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

Little girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time

The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare

She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned

I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh (repeat 2 more times)

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh

After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older
'Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should

This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one

This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeah
But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile

Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go

And I will nibble your ear

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more

It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry, but I've gotta be strong and leave you behind 

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
(I'll always have you)

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
It's still a part of me and you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do

Oooh

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, and I needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you"

It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands, just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're ""here"" not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'ma run 'til you can't walk
But something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh

2008,41,Our Song,Taylor Swift,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is somethin' wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I've heard every hour and listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

See we don't really know
Touch me like this is the last time
See everyday we never know

Promise that you'll love me
I want you to promise me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Like you'll never see me again

2008,48,Teardrops on My Guitar,Taylor Swift,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"

And how life was
Just you and me and loving all of our friends
Living life like an ocean

Now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

'Cause it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking 'em back

'Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in

It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me

But it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a will in me
And now I know that
This could be the end of me

Ooh, but I won't go

See, somehow I can't forget you 
After all that we've been through 

Goin', comin' thought I heard a knock 
Who's there, no one 
Thinking that I deserve it 
Now I realize that I really didn't know 
If you didn't notice you mean everything 
Quickly I'm learning to love again 
All I know is I'm gon' be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (Oh yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV 
Without something there to remind me 
Was it all that easy 
To just put aside your feelings 

If I'm dreaming don't wanna let it 
Hurt my feelings but that's the path 
I believe in 
And I know time will heal it 
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything 
Quickly I'm learning to love again 
All I know is I'm gon' be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (Oh yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)
It's time I let you go 
So I can be free 
And live my life how it should be 
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you 
Yes I will 

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (Ohh)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to (Yes I do)

This all can pass you by 
Didn't I tell you?

But I can't spell it out for you,
No it's never gonna be that simple
No I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And will never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if
We missed out on each other but

It's not the same
No it's never the same
If you don't feel it too
If you meet me half way
If you would meet me half way
It could be the same for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And will never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder
Just realize what I just realized
If you just realize what I just realized

Ooh ooh ooh

Missed out on each other now
Missed out on each other now

Realize, realize, realize, realize"

2008,69,The Time of My Life,David Cook,"I've been waitin' for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed was there all along
Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun

I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life... my life

More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
This is the time of my life
The time of my life
The time of my life"

Never know enough, till it's over, love
Till we lose control, system overload
Screamin' no, no, no, no, no

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to

I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

No, I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before

Where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath

Are you holding back
Like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hangin', spendin' time

That we can make this into

You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps until I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you

We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine

Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours, too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home

2008,81,Love Story,Taylor Swift,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's a real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said...

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!""

2008,85,All Summer Long,Kid Rock,"It was 1989
My thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in between
It was summertime in northern Michigan

Splashing through the sandbar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Turn it up

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves begin to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

We were trying different things

He ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by while he lies
Then turn right round and forgive

I can't take to see your face
With those tears runnin' down your cheeks
But what can I do
I gotta stay true
Cause deep down I'm still a G

And I don't want to come between you and your man

And I can't help but wait

It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You're a queen you should be
Gettin' all that someone's got
You should be rockin' the latest in purses
Bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than that occasional
""I love you, I'm thinking of you""

And I don't wanna come between you and your man no

2008,87,In Love with a Girl,Gavin DeGraw,"So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time
And you know he's gonna be there

Backed a border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

After many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones
Without reading innuendos

But you found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifter's run has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Imma tell you what you do to thank you
Practice what you preach
Now I know, there's nothing we can't reach

'Cause a heart can't erase
Once it finds a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Remember...
Oh, I remember...
I wanna know...

Where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you.
Thinking of all the times we shared.

I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
I'm sad and lonely.

No one knew all the pain I went through.
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you.
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be.
But you made me leave.
And plus my heart, it just, it kept telling me so.

I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I said I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
So sad and lonely.

There was nowhere else to go, oh.
Nobody else to turn to, no.
For the rest of my life
I promised myself, I will love me first genuinely.

I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I said I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
Sad and lonely.

I remember when I walked out.

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear, my dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and it's silent as I wait for you to say
What I need to hear now, your sincere apology
And when you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine, when we're intertwined
Everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do, ohh
You make me love you

2008,93,You're Gonna Miss This,Trace Adkins,"She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining, saying ""I can't wait to turn 18""
She said, ""I'll make my own money and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school""
And she kissed her head and said, ""I was just like you""

You're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it, she's a brand new bride
In her one bedroom apartment and her daddy stops by
He tells her it's a nice place, she says it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
And daddy shakes his head and says ""baby, just slow down""

'Cause you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing, one kid's crying, one kid's screaming
And she keeps apologizing, he says ""they don't bother me 
I've got two babies of my own, one's 36, one's 23""
Huh, it's hard to believe

But you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this, yeah, you're gonna miss this"
2008,94,Love Remains the Same,Gavin Rossdale,"A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like lunar landing
You make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

I find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz sounds just like a 'fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
It's all left still to play

We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we're over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change

I wish this could last forever
I, oh I
As if we could last forever

Love remains the same"

Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right...

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

I never felt like this before
Just when I leave I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

2009,5,Love Story,Taylor Swift,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's a real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said...

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!""

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you!"

When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' 'bout clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on, whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on
Then pop in the night 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade away shot 'cause we ballin'
It's Platinum Patrón every hour

Girl you the drink with all that goody power

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found

Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans
My Benjamin Frank-a-lin's

My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my (plan)
We buildin' castles that's made out of (sand)

She's amazin', fire blazin'
Hotter than cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze, the bottom is wavin' at me
Like ""Damn it, I know ya.""
You wanna shoot like a gun outta holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your sheaufer

You spin my head right round, right round

Yeah, I'm spendin' my money
I'm out of control (hey)
Somebody help me (hey)
She takin' my bank roll

But I'm king of the club
And I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down
Down down down down down down down

2009,7,I'm Yours,Jason Mraz,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours"

Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence love?
And where's that shiny car?
It didn't ever get you far

And you never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers

Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?

Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters

Taking all I want

I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice

It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID 
But you lost the motel key

Spare me your freakin' dirty looks, now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis, why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby, remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
Huh, and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me...

Hey, shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now

Who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never
Wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call
At 4 o'clock in the morning
'Cause I'm the only one you know
In the world that won't be home

Ah, the sun is blinding
I stayed up again
Ooh, I am finding
That's not the way I want my story to end

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're my protection
How do I feel this good sober?

I don't wanna be the girl
Who has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me
Cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that
We had that conversation
I won't remember, save your breath
'Cause what's the use?

Ah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly,
""Come and play""
Ah, I am falling
And if I let myself go
I'm the only one to blame

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're like perfection
How do I feel this good sober?

I'm coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
Looking for myself, sober
I'm coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
Looking for myself, sober

When it's good, then it's good
It's so good till it goes bad
Till you're trying to find
The you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, ""Never again""
Broken down in agony
Just trying to find a friend

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're like perfection
How do I feel this good sober

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me

I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, till it's over, love
Till we lose control, system overload
Screamin' no, no, no, no, no

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
No, I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down

2009,48,If I Were a Boy,Beyoncé,"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy"

2009,50,I Hate This Part,Pussycat Dolls,"We're driving slow through the snow
On Fifth Avenue
And right now radio's
All that we can hear

Man we ain't talked since we left
It's so overdue
It's cold outside
But between us it's worse in here

The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers

I don't want to try now
All that's lefts goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Everyday several takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you it's hurting me

The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers

I don't want to try now
All that's lefts goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothings wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers

I don't want to try now
All that's lefts goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

But I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part

I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take these tears
I hate this part right here"
2009,51,Gotta Be Somebody,Nickelback,"This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of, but dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing; I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene, straight off the silver screen

So I'll be holding my own breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street; out in the moonlight
And, damn it, this feels too right
It's just like déjà vu; me, standing here with you

So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Ooh, you can't give up (when you're looking for) 
A diamond in the rough (because you never know) 
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh...

Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Nobody wants to be the last one there (when you're looking for)

I can cut you into pieces

Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest

I mean it, I promise

2009,55,Viva la Vida,Coldplay,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing

To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes

Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
All across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow

And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss
In every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret
And each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide

The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes

Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in your closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe"

Every night I rest in my bed 
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you 
When I close my eyes 
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hand and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this? 

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true 
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere

I wrap you around all of my thoughts

To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this? 

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

2009,70,If Today Was Your Last Day,Nickelback,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day,
If today was your last day.

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try,
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day...
Would you make your mark
By mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars,
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
'cause the hands of time
Are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late,
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?

Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day"

And don't leave the house till the booze gone
And don't have sex if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new joint

Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun

Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered

2009,78,21 Guns,Green Day,"Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?

Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you've lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn’t pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You’re in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I"

2009,81,Chicken Fried,Zac Brown Band,"You know I like my chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well, I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in Southern ground

And a little bit o' chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Well, it's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind; this I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit o' chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well, I've seen a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get ya little chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

2009,84,Then,Brad Paisley,"I remember trying not to stare the night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later in the front porch light
Taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn’t told you yet, but I thought I loved you then

And now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world
And I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been
We’ve come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then

I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There people around but I didn’t care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again, I thought I loved you then

And now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world
I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it’s ever been
We’ve come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then

I can just see you with a baby on the way
I can just see you when your hair is turning grey
What I can’t see is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I’ve said that before

And now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world
And I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl
We’ll look back someday, at this moment that we’re in 
And I’ll look at you and say, ""and I thought I loved you then""
And I thought I loved you then"

Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

And she says ooh
I can't take no more

And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
Way down

Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

Till by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
And tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be all right
She'll be all right
Just not tonight

And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
But her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling

I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down
I can't take no more

Were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say,
""God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy""

He said ""I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damn if I know""
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said ""These damn things will kill me yet,
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

Last call its 2:00am
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face

Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh but me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"
2009,94,Whatever It Is,Zac Brown Band,"She got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And the pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people askin' why it is, I tell them I don't know
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

Now when she loves me
Girl, that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me I can live forever
And when she loves me I am untouchable

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you, I do""
You got whatever it is
Oh, you got whatever it is"
2009,95,Already Gone,Kelly Clarkson,"Remember all the things we wanted?
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you
Now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you want to cry
Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough
To let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

(Already gone, already gone, already gone) ooh woah
Already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

Remember all the things we wanted?
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better

2009,96,Goodbye,Kristinia DeBarge,"Am I supposed to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act

I'll be alright

And get yourself together

2009,99,Pretty Wings,Maxwell,"Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants, no trace
No residual feelings within you
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love you
I hope you feel the same

Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affection
Had to fill out my prescription for the remedy
I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly
The way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to live
I had to live
I had to leave
I had to leave

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To flap your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around

I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into ""like""
Baby believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep till I die a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times
Better days, and I miss you more and more

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To flap your pretty wings around

2010,2,Need You Now,Lady Antebellum,"Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone, 'cause I can't fight it any more
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot o' whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do

I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny 

I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you; like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
You so gangster; I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?

But things were kind of heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece: I'm complete

You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

2010,18,Just the Way You Are,Bruno Mars,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah"
2010,19,Cooler Than Me,Mike Posner,"If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say ""hey"" or remember my name, and
It's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow shoes on your feet
And you wear them around like it ain't shh
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Or who you think that you are

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks

You wear 'em around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say ""hey"" or remember my name, and
It's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Or who you think that you are

'Cause it sure seems (it sure seems)
You got no doubt (that you got no doubts)
But we all see (we all see)
You got your head in the clouds.

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm (under my arm)

2010,24,Not Afraid,Eminem,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) (Yeah) to take a stand (to take a stand) (It's been a ride)
Everybody (I guess I had to) (everybody), come take my hand (Go to that place) (come take my hand) (To get to this one)
We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road"

Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams

I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hit my head against the wall

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

CHORUS:
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mom's telling me I should think twice
But love to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My esteem is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack-head

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
(All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

So I got a question:
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love, huh your drug?
Your drug, huh your drug
Huh your drug, is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(They said farewell)

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

Hey, hey, hey
I doubt you’ll find another
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey
I'll be the one that you remember

And I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart

Too many times I’ve been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I’m done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I bet if I give all my love

And I know that you may love me,
But I just can't be with you like this anymore,

She's got both hands, in her pocket,
And she won't look at you, won't look at you.
She hides true love, en su bolsillo,
She's got a halo around her finger, around you.

You know that I love you, boy,
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I've gotta choose,
Nothing to lose.

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro.

Just smoke my cigarette and hush.

But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like a dad.
And all those flames that burned before him,
Now, he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad.

I swear, now I can't take it
Knowin' somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I shoulda' put it down, shoulda' got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air

Tryin' to get my Usher on, but I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinkin' all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

And I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream

Will she come back? No one knows

And now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything

Better than I've ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get wit ya chick just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib

How many licks does it takes till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home
I could make me show stop
Soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really gettin' low then Ima shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel
But when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well

No discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butterican pecan peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces

With a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big
Well there just one thing that I gotta know

And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing
And the other's half's luck

Whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me

2010,46,Mine,Taylor Swift,"You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)

We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say ""I love you,"" enough
Till it's too late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would've done?

Yeah, we gotta stop
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given if
This is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that
Every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or throw it all away
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying

And if you plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
So when we long for absolution, there'll be no one on the line

Like we're dying (x4)

You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till its head on
Why we think we're right when we're dead wrong,
You never know a good thing till it's gone

I know things are looking up, but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowin' our name

They got

They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down

Do you think I'm special?
Do you think I'm nice, am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear, and the sound you like
Are we just sinking in a ocean of faces?
It can't be possible that rain could fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over their world instead, they got, they got

All the right friends in all the right places, so yeah, we're goin' down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down

It don't matter what you see, I know I could never be
Someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say, I know I could never fake
Someone that could sound like you

All the right friends in all the right places, (so yeah, we're goin' down)
All the right moves and all the right faces, (so yeah, we're goin' down)

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find

Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door

Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive,
Looking for something wild

And now we looking like pimps
In my Gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight
I don't give a-
I don't give a-

If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious.
Tear it down,
'Til the sun comes back around

And now we looking so smash
Knocking over trash cans
E'rybody breaking bottles
It's a filthy hot-mess
I'm down to get payed.
I'm not the designated driver so
I don't give a-
I don't give a-

Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

All right bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker

Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones
Bitch I run it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year

Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now. man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame

And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer

But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on

They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear

There is nothing to say

Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,

If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines.
Plans were drawn, concrete poured,
And nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can.
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me."
2010,92,If I Die Young,The Band Perry,"If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh, oh oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, you know
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep them in your pocket
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them, oh

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls"
2010,93,The Only Exception,Paramore,"When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist, but darling

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Well, maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing"
2010,94,American Honey,Lady Antebellum,"She grew up on a side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good
She grew up slow
Like American honey

Steady as a preacher
Free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin'
But wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Get caught in the race
Of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yea

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey

Ooh There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin's sweeter than summertime
And American honey
And American honey"
2010,95,King of Anything,Sara Bareilles,"Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside

So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by

You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked

So let me thank you for your time
And try not to waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast

I hate to break it you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Oh...

You sound so innocent
All full of good intent
You swear you know best

But you expect me to
Jump up on board with you and ride off into your delusional sunset

I'm not the one who's lost
With no direction, oh
But you'll ever see

You're so busy makin' maps
With my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

All my life
I've tried
To make everybody happy while I
Just hurt
And hide
Waitin' for someone to tell me it's my turn
To decide

Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Who cares if you disagree
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Let me hold your crown, babe
Oh oh, ooh
Ah..."
2010,96,Life After You,Daughtry,"Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong but you already know
Believe me I won't stop at nothin' 
To see you so I've started runnin'

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time
Oh why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you"
2010,97,Smile,Uncle Kracker,"You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler then the flip side of my pillow, that's right

Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
Let me know that it's okay, yeah it's okay
And the moments when my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack 
And just like that
You steal away the rain and just like that

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Ohh, you make me smile

Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

(Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile

(Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile"

2010,99,Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart,Alicia Keys,"Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

And all the time you were tellin' me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right till the end Ooh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love

And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you"

I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back

Broke up before I get to go and I got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
